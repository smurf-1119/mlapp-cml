"showers continued throughout the week in
the bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
january and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
comissaria smith said in its weekly review.
    the dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    arrivals for the week ended february 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    comissaria smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. with total bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    there are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +bahia superior+ certificates.
    in view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    comissaria smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for march shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    new crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
june/july going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under new york july, aug/sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne fob.
    routine sales of butter were made. march/april sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    april/may butter went at 2.27 times new york may, june/july
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, aug/sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times new york sept and oct/dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times new york dec, comissaria smith said.
    destinations were the u.s., covertible currency areas,
uruguay and open ports.
    cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
march/april, 785 dlrs for may, 753 dlrs for aug and 0.39 times
new york dec for oct/dec.
    buyers were the u.s., argentina, uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    liquor sales were limited with march/april selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, june/july at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times new
york july, aug/sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times new york
sept and oct/dec at 1.25 times new york dec, comissaria smith
said.
    total bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    final figures for the period to february 28 are expected to
be published by the brazilian cocoa trade commission after
carnival which ends midday on february 27.

"bankamerica corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    some analysts said they have recommended bankamerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the securities and exchange commission.
    bankamerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    the stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
first interstate bancorp <i> takeover bid gone, bankamerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    bankamerica filed the offer on january 26. it was seen as
one of the major factors leading the first interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on february 9.
    a bankamerica spokesman said sec approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    ""the circumstances at the time will determine what we do,""
said arthur miller, bankamerica's vice president for financial
communications, when asked if bankamerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives sec approval.
    ""i'd put it off as long as they conceivably could,"" said
lawrence cohn, analyst with merrill lynch, pierce, fenner and
smith.
    cohn said the longer bankamerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    although bankamerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to bankamerica stock
holders, noted daniel williams, analyst with sutro group.
    several analysts said that while they believe the brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    nevertheless, bankamerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if brazil pays no interest for a year, said joseph
arsenio, analyst with birr, wilson and co.
    he noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    with other major banks standing to lose even more than
bankamerica if brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

"venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
february, bankers said.
    they declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    the committee was meeting in new york this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    ""a number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place,"" one senior banker said.
    the interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over eurodollar rates, but venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    it also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in venezuela.
    the breakthrough in the venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between chile and its bank advisory panel.
    and last night citibank said mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on march 20.
    while the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
friday. by striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate brazil.

"the tower commission report, which
says president reagan was ignorant about much of the iran arms
deal, just about ends his prospects of regaining political
dominance in washington, political analysts said.
    ""this is certification of incompetence,"" private political
analyst stephen hess told reuters in commenting on the tower
report made public today.
    ""it's as if he went before a professional licensing board
and was denied credentials.""
    in one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman john
tower, a longtime reagan supporter and former republican
senator from texas, told a press conference, ""the president
clearly did not understand the nature of this operation.""
    the report, which lent credence to widespread opinion in
washington that reagan is not in full command of the
government, was particularly damaging because it was prepared
by a board of the republican president's own choosing.
    the three-member panel made up of tower, former national
security adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of state
edmund muskie, does not carry the partisan taint of criticism
from a congress controlled by the democratic party.
    ""we're falling by our own hand,"" said one republican
political strategist. ""what can we say except 'we're sorry, we
won't do it again'?""
    the strategist, who works for one of his party's top 1988
presidential contenders and asked not to be identified, said
the report was like ""an anvil falling on us.""
    hess, with the brookings institution public policy study
group, said the report is the final blow to reagan's hopes of
regaining the upper hand he once had in dealings with congress,
the press and the washington bureaucracy.
    the report may also undermine the standing of defense
secretary caspar weinberger and secretary of state george
shultz, who the report suggests were more interested in keeping
their own skirts clean than supporting the president.
    ""they protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences,"" it said.
    white house chief of staff donald regan and former central
intelligence agency director william casey also received strong
criticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.
    regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged
for allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran
initiative and to avoid ""chaos"" in the disclosure process.
    casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous
brain tumor in december, had already resigned for health
reasons last month.
    ""this is a story about people who came up somewhat short of
being heroes,"" tower told reporters.
    while reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,
including command of the armed forces and the right to veto
legislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to
retake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly
with congress controlled by the democrats.
    the crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the
man in the street will forsake reagan over the affair.
    although his job approval rating has fallen as much as
twenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms
deal with iran became public last november, his personal
popularity is still relatively high.
    a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed
that just 37 pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in
control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was
doing a good job as president.
    american enterprise institute analyst william schneider, a
democrat, says reagan's loss of support among washington power
brokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.
    ""in the past, he has been able to go around the power elite
by appealing directly to the public,"" schneider said.
    reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised
address next week.
    but one top republican strategist warned against expecting
a dramatic turnaround.
    ""the white house has to avoid building expectations that
cannot be met,"" said the strategist, who requested anonymity.
""they have to recognize there is no quick fix.""
    analysts also point out that reagan's personal popularity
has not always translated into public backing for his policies.
    they note he was dramatically rebuffed in last november's
elections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control
of the senate to the democrats.

"a surprise 7.5 pct drop in u.s. january
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the u.s. economy
in the first quarter of 1987, economists said.
    with total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the u.s. economy.
    but they stressed that the 1987 tax reform laws may be a
primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    ""it's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said david
wyss of data resources inc. ""i'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought.""
    the commerce department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    ""it's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much,"" wyss said.
     increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    november durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and december's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    but most acknowledged that the huge january drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    ""the wash-out that took place in january was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in november and
december,"" said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc. ""the
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year.""
    ""the report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters,"" said donald maude
of midland montagu capital markets inc.
    maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. in
november, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in december they
fell 0.6 pct and in january 0.7 pct, he said.
    ""it suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production,"" midland
montagu's maude said.
    wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
january's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    but he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
december.
    he also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in january
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in december.
    ""given these numbers, there's no reason for the fed to
tighten,"" data resources' wyss said.
    ""but there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. the fed will wait and see,"" he added.
    sullivan predicted the fed will ease by easter. ""people
aren't talking recession or fed easing now, but the fed will

"the chairmen and senior republican
members of the house and senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    the proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    if adopted by congress it would effect all transactions
after sept 26, 1987.
    the plan was proposed by house ways and means committee
chairman dan rostenkowski (d-ill), rep john duncan (r-tenn),
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen (d-tex) and sen
bob packwood (r-ore).
    in a statement rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. the narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    he said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to esops.
    senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen said in a
statement, ""the tax reform act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die.""
    he added, ""the provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated.""
    he added, ""the bill i have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose.""

"quebecor inc, one of canada's largest
publishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new
daily newspaper in montreal, probably this fall, president
pierre peladeau told reuters in an interview.
    the company, which last week won a bid to buy the quebec
government's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <donohue
inc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper
mill in matane, quebec, peladeau said.
    ""i would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... this
is not definite but i think we will,"" he said, adding that he
plans to announce a decision early next week.
    quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln canadian dlrs last
year and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily
newspapers, including the tabloid le journal de montreal, the
second-largest circulation paper in canada.
    a new daily would give montreal its second english-
language paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city
the most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in north
america, analysts have said.
    peladeau said market studies have indicated a new english
language tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six
months. he said he is waiting to determine whether the new
venture would have the support of major advertisers.
    peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55
pct of quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of
two major canadian companies who are interested in the project
but has not decided whether he would take partners in the
newspaper venture.
    he said he would consider launching the newspaper with one
of the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.
    ""it would be the possibility of doing something else in the
short term,"" peladeau said.
    peladeau said the joint acquisition of donohue with robert
maxwell's british printing and communications corp plc <bpcl.l>
does not mean quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.
    peladeau and maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake
in donohue, which resulted in quebecor buying 51 pct of the
govvernment's stake for about 165 mln canadian dlrs and british
printing acquiring the other 49 pct.
    ""in 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of
newsprint. there were days when we didn't have enough paper to
print the paper,"" peladeau said. ""when i lived that, i said to
myself...next time we'll be ready.""
    peladeau said most of donohue's current total newsprint
capacity however, is already committed to other buyers.
    quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year
and maxwell's company, which publishes britain's daily mirror
newspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.
    peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49
pct owned by the new york times, (nyt.a), adding to donohue's
540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will
have to install another paper machine at amos, quebec, or build
another mill to meet their demands .
    he said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or
other types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be
on stream in two years. he said a mill in matane, a depressed
area with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the
government.
    peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures
with maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in
france or in the u.s., where the company owns two large
printing plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.
    he said maxwell's sons, who are french citizens, would
provide an entree into the french market, where foreigners are
prevented from buying newspapers. peladeau said he would
consider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in
france or the u.s.
    quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of
about 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of
two groups of weekly newspapers in the u.s., and is negotiating
the acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in canada,
peladeau said.
    he said the company may consider starting daily newspapers
in two small quebec cities and buying radio stations in the
province.
    peladeau said quebecor may also consider trading in its
listing on the american stock exchange for a new york stock
exchange listing.

"u.s. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
wednesday february 25, the federal reserve said.
    the fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. the week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    commenting on the two-week statement period ended february
25, the fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    a federal reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the fed's reserve
projections in the week to wednesday.
    he said that natural float had been ""acting a bit
strangely"" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    the spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both thursday and wednesday.
    the fed spokeman could give no reason for thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated fed districts.
    for the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were ""small,"" adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    the spokesman said that on both tuesday and wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 est on both days.
    however, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    during the week ended wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    on wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    the fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on thursday, monday and tuesday and a deficit on
friday and wedndsday. that produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    for the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

"american express co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its shearson
lehman brothers inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    american express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of american
express. the rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    american express closed on the new york stock exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    american express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    at the meeting, company officials said american express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of shearson, according to analysts.
    yesterday, shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, jeffery lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. it also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
american express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    ""i think it is highly unlikely that american express is
going to sell shearson,"" said perrin long of lipper analytical.
he questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very
profitable securities firm.""
    several analysts said american express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    but others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    larry eckenfelder of prudential-bache securities said he
believes american express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    ""shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization,"" said eckenfelder.
    some analysts said american express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    ""they have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. you want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road,"" said e.f. hutton group analyst michael lewis.
    ""they've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena,"" said lewis. ""...that does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way,"" he said.
    lewis said if american express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    ""it could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. the value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.
     lewis said shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

"a study on grain certificates due out
shortly from the government accounting office (gao) could show
that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
    analysis that the gao has obtained from the agriculture
department and the office of management and budget suggests
that certificates cost more than cash payments, a gao official
told reuters.
    gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific
request of sen. jesse helms (r-n.c.), former chairman of the
senate agriculture committee.
    the report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid march.
    the cost of certificates, said the gao source, depends on
the program's impact on the usda loan program.
    if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan
entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
the program would go up. however, if it is determined that
certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
    gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates
program should be slowed or expanded, the gao official said.
    but a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire
against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said.
    the omb is said to be against any expansion of the program,
while usda remains firmly committed to it.

"opec may be forced to meet before a
scheduled june session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    ""the movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as opec thought. they may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems,"" said daniel yergin, director of cambridge energy
research associates, cera.
    analysts and oil industry sources said the problem opec
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    ""opec's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way,"" said paul mlotok, oil
analyst with salomon brothers inc.
    he said the market's earlier optimism about opec and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    but some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of opec production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last december.
    ""opec has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,"" said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. ""the market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again,"" he added.
    david t. mizrahi, editor of mideast reports, expects opec
to meet before june, although not immediately. however, he is
not optimistic that opec can address its principal problems.
    ""they will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late march and april
when demand slackens,"" mizrahi said.
    but mizrahi said that opec is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.""
    analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
opec's ability to hold together prices and output.
    ""opec must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then,"" said dillard
spriggs of petroleum analysis ltd in new york.
    but bijan moussavar-rahmani of harvard university's energy
and environment policy center said that the demand for opec oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    ""demand for their (opec) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is opec meeting this
demand through current production,"" he told reuters in a

expressed ""grave concern"" to chief debt negotiator antonio
padua de seixas over the country's suspension of interest
payments, according to a telex from committee chairman citibank
to creditor banks worldwide.
    bankers said the diplomatic phrase belied the deep anger
and frustration on the committee over brazil's unilateral move
last friday and its subsequent freeze on some 15 billion dlrs
of short-term trade and interbank lines.
    seixas, director of the brazilian central bank's foreign
debt department, met the full panel on tuesday and wednesday.
    seixas, who met again this morning with senior citibank
executive william rhodes and representatives from committee
vice-chairmen morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc,
told the banks that the government was preparing a telex to
explain and clarify the freeze on short-term credits.
    the telex could be sent to creditors as early as today,
bankers said.
    despite the rising tempers, bankers said there are no plans
for brazilian finance minister dilson funaro to meet commercial
bankers during his trip to washington on friday and saturday.
    funaro will be explaining brazil's actions to u.s. treasury
secretary james baker, federal reserve board chairman paul
volcker and international monetary fund managing director
michel camdessus before travelling to europe at the weekend.
    meanwhile, bankers were to hear in new york this afternoon
what impact brazil's hard line would have on argentina, with an
initial presentation from argentine treasury secretary mario
brodersohn on his country's request for 2.15 billion dlrs in
new loans and a multi-year rescheduling agreement. argentina
has threatened to emulate brazil's payments moratorium if the
banks do not grant its request.

"liquefied natural gas imports from
algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
economically feasible, u.s. industry analysts sources said.
    youcef yousfi, director-general of sonatrach, the algerian
state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
algiers that such imports would be made this year.
    ""contract negotiations, filing with the u.s. government and
the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
the import until 1988/1989,"" daniel tulis, a natural gas
analyst with shearson lehman bros. said.
    sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
customers, panhandle eastern <pel> and distrigas, a subsidiary
of cabot corp <cbt> to resume lng export, company officials
told reuters. a third, el paso gas, a subsidiary of burlington
northern <bni>, has expressed no interest.
    industry analysts said some imports of algerian lng were
feasible. ""on a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
made capital investment to handle lng import can operate
profitably even in the current price environment,""  frank
spadine, an energy economist with bankers trust, said.
   analysts did not forsee a major impact from algerian imports
on u.s. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
higher by the end of 1987.
    a decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring gulf of
mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
prices, shearson's tulis said.
   in this context, algerian lng import would be a source of
supplemental supply to u.s. domestic production, he added.
    company sources currently in talks with algeria agree,
saying that algerian lng would only serve to meet peak demand.
    company sources also said that any negotiations with
algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
volumes to market requirements and prices to u.s. spot market
values.

"the chairman of the senate agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    ""we're going to have a bill to markup, i guarantee you,
before the easter recess,"" sen. david boren (d-okla.) said.
    senate majority leader robert byrd (d-w.va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by april 11, when
congress is scheduled to break for easter, boren said.
    boren urged the farm credit administration (fca), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    under the 1985 farm credit law passed by congress, the fca,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    however, fca chairman frank naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. the other republican member of
the three-man fca board, marvin duncan, agreed.
    but boren urged that even if fca cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    ""we all know we need a capital infusion,"" boren said.
    boren and the fca officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. also at the hearing, brent
beesely, chief executive of the farm credit council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    while he did not ask for government aid, beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    ""a significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses,"" beesley said.
    jim billington, democratic member of the fca board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    the system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    fca board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    ""the bondholders have no worry at this time,"" billington
said.
    naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. the proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    but he and the system spokesman beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    naylor and beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. but beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without congressional legislation.

"the tower commission's scathing   
comments on president reagan's embattled chief of staff donald
regan could signal the death knell to his white house tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to iran and diversion of profits to nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last november.
    but criticism of the roles of secretary of state george
shultz and defense secretary caspar weinberger, who said they
opposed the iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the tower commission report.
    ""their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president,"" the report said after a three-month probe.
    ""instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
they protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. they were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages.""
    the report saved some of its most scathing language for
regan, a gruff former wall street executive and close personal
friend of reagan whose autocratic rule in the white house
angered some top reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, reagan's wife nancy.
    ""more than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the white house staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser,"" said
the report.
    washington analysts said regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the tower
commission's findings next week.
    with regan's departure apparently imminent and poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of shultz and weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    senate republican leader robert dole, a key reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed ""colossal blunders"" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    ""it would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on,"" the kansas republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    one republican strategist said he believed regan would not
be the only white house official to leave in the near future.

"the u.s. agriculture department is not
actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the soviet
union under the export enhancement program (eep), senior usda
officials said.
    however, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    ""the grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,""
an aide to agriculture secretary richard lyng said. ""but there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""
    most analysts interviewed by reuters were more confident
than usda officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
soviets, even though u.s. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    but administration and private sources agreed that if the
reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
moscow, it could take several months.
    ""i just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process,"" the aide to lyng said.
    ""an export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,""
said one former usda official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
china wheat under the subsidy program.
    an official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within usda might be nudged along by members of
congress, a number of whom urged usda this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the soviets.
    but lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
capitol hill yesterday, house members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    the administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer moscow wheat under the eep, officials
at the u.s. trade representative's office said.
    in their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous eep offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. one usda official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm,
basic, factual economics.""
    another usda official said there was ""not even an informal
suggestion or hint"" that the soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    usda and private sources agreed that consideration of an
eep initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the white house stemming
from the iran arms affair.

"the u.s. treasury said it was willing
to participate with several other industrial countries in
providing a 500 mln-dlr short-term bridge loan to argentina.
    the treasury announcecement did not name the other
countries nor the amount of financing the united states was
willing to supply.
    argentina announced a wage and price freeze on wednesday
night and is negotiating with new york bankers for about 2.15
billion dlrs in new loans and other financing.
    ""our willingness to participate in this multilateral
short-term financing indicates our support for argentina's
economic program to achieve sustainable growth and a viable
balance of payments position,"" the treassury statement said.
    in announcing a four-month wage and price freeze, argentine
officials said the country needed ""a more serene climate"" to
carry out structural changes in the economy.
    but argentina did not suspend interest payments on its
foreign debts, as neighboring brazil did last week.
    the treasury said the u.s. share of bridge financing for
argentina would come from its exchange stabilization fund.
    the one-page statement noted the international monetary
fund expressed confidence in argentina's economic policies and
prospects by approving a new stand-by financing arrangement for
it on february 18.
    ""argentina is expected to qualify for imf
balance-of-payments financing which would enable argentina to
repay a multilateral bridge loan and support the implementation
of its economic program,"" the statement said.
    the latest argentine action marked the second time in less
than two years its government has used a wage and price freeze
to restrain inflation.
    the debt talks in new york are being headed by argentine
finance minister mario brodersohn and are expected to last for
several days.
    along with new financing, argentina reportedly wants lower
interest rates on an existing total 53 billion dlrs in foreign
debt and elimination of foreign banks' control over how some of
the money is loaned in argentina.

"the sharp decline in soybean crush ratios
seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has
pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean
processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean
meal and oil.
    the weekly u.s. soybean crush rate was reported by the
national soybean processors association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    active soymeal export loadings at the gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    however, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop south american soymeal over the next
few months.
    u.s. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby march contract today.
    ""many speculators down here bought march soymeal and sold
may, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause march to gain on deferreds),"" one cbt crush
trader said.
    ""but they've been bailing out this week because the march
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added.
    as a result of the weakness in soymeal, the march crush
ratio (the value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    the may crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    with futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    a central illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. but
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

"latest federal reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    ""the numbers were a little disappointing, but i think we
can take mr volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed,"" said bob bannon of security pacific national bank.
    fed chairman paul volcker told a congressional committee
last thursday that the fed's policy ""has been unchanged up to
today.""
    although volcker's statement last thursday allayed most
fears that the fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    this need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since april of last year,
economists added.
    today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    ""the one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on wednesday,"" said dana johnson of
first national bank of chicago. ""but there was a clearly
justified need for them. there was nothing ominous.""
    ""the fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. if it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections,"" added security pacific's bannon.
    a fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    for the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    ""there were wire problems at two large banks on tuesday and
wednesday, so i am not too bothered about the borrowings,"" said
scott winningham of j.s. winningham and co. the wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    ""for the time being, the fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct,"" said darwin beck of
first boston corp. ""i expect it to continue in that vein.""
    ""excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs,"" added first chicago's johnson. banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    after the fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward m-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended february 16.
    looking ahead, economists said the fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    ""the market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
fed policy,"" said first chicago's johnson. ""of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing.""

"japanese life insurers, trust banks and
corporations, largely responsible for vitalising the u.s. bond
market in recent years, are now eyeing stockmarkets in the
u.s., britain, france and hong kong, fund managers said.
    after concentrating on u.s. treasury bonds for years,
japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on
similar types of investments, they said.
    japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may
double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in
1986, shigeki matsumoto of nikko securities co ltd, said.
    matsumoto, who manages nikko's investment research and
strategy, said there is evidence japanese investors began
poking around in foreign stockmarkets around july last year,
but few made firm commitments until december when net purchases
suddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each
of the previous five months.
    net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.
    this sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw
the widest smiles from wall street because about 70 to 80 pct
of funds will be invested in the u.s. markets, matsumoto said.
    ""the trend has been to head toward the u.s. market, first
because of its size and next because it has been successful
over the last couple of years,"" said eugene atkinson, managing
director of goldman sachs international corp.
    wall street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,
enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in
and out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.
    however, few see holdings in u.s. treasuries dwindling.
they will remain a japanese mainstay, fund managers said.
    institutions, particularly life insurance companies which
concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover
payouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their u.s.
treasuries, but will put in less money, said shinichi kobuse,
manager of yamaichi securities co ltd's international fixed
income activities.
    there has been some selling of u.s. bonds by short-term
investors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a
significant chunk of japanese bond holdings because the
liquidity of the u.s. bond market remains attractive, he added.
    kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the u.s.
equity markets despite predictions by economists the u.s.
economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.
    interest in wall street has been spurred by recent reports
of significant growth in earnings by major u.s. corporations,
he added.
    yutaka hashimoto general manager of nippon life insurance
co told an economic conference that insurance companies, which
are responsible for 26 pct of japanese funds in foreign
securities, hold a lopsided proportion of u.s. treasuries and
intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.
    insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their
funds into the u.s., but will now invest in britain, west
germany, france and other countries, hashimoto said.
    lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks
relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the
strength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to
offset currency risks, he added.
    one trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct
annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in
u.s. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund
investment stategies.
    the bank is looking more at u.s. equities and european
bonds, he said.
    japanese investments in british equities have already
turned active and the pace is likely to increase, said andrew
sheaf, general manager of international equity activities at
county securities japan.
    ""last week was the busiest week we had,"" he said.
    investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of
british companies and the recent deregulation of government
controlled firms, fund managers said.
    deregulation in france is also attracting japanese
interest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by
worries about the french franc, they said.
    investments in hong kong will be mostly short-term and
speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term
political stability, they added.
    japanese investors are cautious about west germany,
particularly as german firms, like their japanese counterparts,
are concerned about the recent dollar fall.
    australia also poses some risks due to currency values,
they added.

"japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in paris,
finance ministry sources said.
    they said the cut is based on a revision of the trust fund
bureau law, which should be approved by parliament on march 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    the bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    the base lending rate for state bodies such as the japan
development bank, people's finance corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    however, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on january 28, because the trust fund
bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    the ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    on tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective february 28.
the move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the posts and
telecommunications ministry and the japan welfare annuity of
the ministry of health and welfare, the sources said.
    these ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,

"talks on the possibility of reintroducing
global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with
sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was
not included in a key negotiating forum.
    the special meeting of the international coffee
organization (ico) council was called to find a way to stop a
prolonged slide in coffee prices.
    however, delegates said no solution to the question of how
to implement quotas was yet in sight.
    world coffee export quotas -- the major device used to
regulate coffee prices under the international coffee agreement
-- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to
a drought which cut brazil""s output by nearly two thirds.
    brazil is the world""s largest coffee producer and exporter.
    producers and consumers now are facing off over the
question of how quotas should be calculated under any future
quota distribution scheme, delegates said.
    tempers flared late saturday when a minority group of eight
producing countries was not represented in a contact group of
five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which
was set up to facilitate debate.
    the big producers ""want to have the ball only in their court
and it isn""t fair,"" minority producer spokesman luis escalante of
costa rica said.
    the majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas
april 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota
shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before
september 30, delegates said.
    their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing brazil
to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export
market, colombia 17 pct, ivory coast seven pct and indonesia
six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.
    but consuming countries and the dissident producer group
have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined
by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable
production and stocks statistics.
    their proposals would give brazil a smaller quota share and
colombia and indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota
distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.
    brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal
that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.
    delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on
a quota package. ""anything is possible at this phase,"" even
adjournment of the meeting until march or april, one said.
    if the ico does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the
supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a
result, industry sources said.
    retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about
steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an
upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,
they said.

"britain""s ruling conservatives have
enlarged their lead over the opposition labour party, according
to results of two opinion polls released on saturday.
    a market & opinion research international (mori) poll
conducted for the sunday times showed the conservatives with a
six point lead, while a poll by telephone surveys limited for
the sunday express found them to be four points ahead.
    the sunday express poll is the first conducted since the
social democratic party scored an upset victory on thursday in
a parliamentary by-election in the former labour stronghold of
greenwich, near london.
    the mori poll, conducted in the six days leading up to the
by-election, showed the conservatives with 41 pct of the vote,
labour with 35 pct and the alliance of social democrats and
liberals with 21 pct.
    the sunday express said its poll, conducted on friday,
found the conservatives ahead with 35.6 pct of the vote, labour
with 31.9 pct and the alliance with 31.4 pct.
    a harris poll published in the observer newspaper last

"indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow
by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
declines, the u.s. embassy said in a report.
    production of indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to
fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
indonesia""s agricultural performance.
    the government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
1987.
    the report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
a drawdown on stocks.
    ""growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
gain,"" the report says.
    ""the modest overall increase which is expected will be due
to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
and palm kernels.""
    constraints to significant overall increases in
agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
report underlines.
    the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
largely offset gains in yields.
    the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
resistant rice types.
    the government is depending on increased production of
export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
oil prices.
    palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
report says.
    but while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (oct-sept) will
rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
    the report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
september""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
in domestic demand.
    the report said that indonesia""s overall economic
performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s. it compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
in 1984.
    the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
for the slump.

"kuwait""s oil minister, in remarks
published today, said there were no plans for an emergency opec
meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
oil prices.
    sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah was quoted by the local
daily al-qabas as saying: ""none of the opec members has asked
for such a meeting.""
    he denied kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
limits of the 13-nation organisation.
    traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
opec is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
bpd agreed in geneva last december.
    they named kuwait and the united arab emirates, along with
the much smaller producer ecuador, among those producing above
quota. kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
    ""this rumour is baseless. it is based on reports which said
kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. they suppose that
because kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister
said.
    sheikh ali has said before that kuwait had the ability to
produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
    ""if we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
share, it means we in kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.
    he was referring apparently to the gulf state of qatar,
which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
official prices restored by opec last month pegged to a marker
of 18 dlrs per barrel.
    prices in new york last week dropped to their lowest levels
this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
19 dollars a barrel.
    sheikh ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international
oil company that declared kuwait sold below official prices.""
    because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
    however, kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
of its local and international refining facilities and its own
distribution network abroad, he added.
    he reaffirmed that the planned meeting march 7 of opec""s
differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
april at the request of certain of the body""s members.
    ecuador""s deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite said
last wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted opec to assign
a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.
    referring to pressure by oil companies on opec members, in
apparent reference to difficulties faced by qatar, he said: ""we
expected such pressure. it will continue through march and
april."" but he expected the situation would later improve.

"indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the u.s. embassy says in a new report.
    to counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    indonesia, the only asian member of opec and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in september.
    but the u.s. embassy report says president suharto""s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    ""(it) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
the report says. it primarily assesses indonesia""s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
performance.
    it says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
    ""this group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
the report says.
    indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the world
bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    three sets of measures have been announced since last may,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    the report says indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. ""this is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
    indonesia, the largest country in south-east asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
april.
    but the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. ""for 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry.""
    ""growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
    bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    a new world bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the bank said.

announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    the deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    in a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, finance and petroleum minister sheikh
abdul-aziz bin khalifa al-thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6

    sheikh abdul-aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    the government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    sheikh abdul-aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    he urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. he
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    sheikh abdul-aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    he added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    no figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. there was also no projection for oil revenue.

"gulf money markets have grown reasonably
well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain
to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <gulf
international bank bsc> (gib) said.
    the bank's economist henry azzam said in a review of gulf
capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional
investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank
accounts and precious metals.
    ""greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with
more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the
disclosure requirements on company accounts,"" he said.
    the gib study reviewed capital markets under three
categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.
    azzam said gulf states had been making greater use of
short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had
floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.
    ""nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large
extent, fragmented and lagging behind,"" he said.
    most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans
and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of
stock or bond issues. only kuwait has an official stock
exchange, while other gulf nations have yet to establish
exchanges.
    but with dwindling financial surpluses in the gulf,
governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital
markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, azzam said.
    he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had
""clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital
markets in the region.""
    in addition, family firms are reluctant to go public,
financial awareness among investors is still lacking and
investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack
depth. a sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted
investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.
    azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some
gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt
financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.
    he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation
of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.
    azzam said capital market instruments should be made
available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation
council (gcc) states -- bahrain, kuwait, qatar, oman, saudi
arabia and the united arab emirates (uae). some moves had been
taken in this direction, with bahrain allowing gcc nationals to
own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.
    azzam said gulf money markets had received greater depth
from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in bahrain and
the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in saudi
arabia.
    but he added there is ""no bond market to speak of"" in saudi
arabia, qatar, oman or the uae, with the last saudi riyal
denominated bond issued in 1978.
    while bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading
in saudi arabia has picked up, establishment of formal
exchanges in qatar, oman and the uae does not appear imminent,

reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last december's opec
accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the
official saudi press agency spa said.
    asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market
oil prices, nazer said saudi arabia ""is fully adhering by the
... accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the
pronounced prices under any circumstance.""
    nazer, quoted by spa, said recent pressure on free market
prices ""may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere)
winter season and the glut in the market.""
    saudi arabia was a main architect of the december accord,
under which opec agreed to lower its total output ceiling by
7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in
mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. free market prices
are currently just over 16 dlrs.
    nazer was quoted by the spa as saying saudi arabia's
adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.
    he said contacts among members of opec showed they all
wanted to stick to the accord.

country's 33.5 billion dlr foreign debt were concrete, open and
frank, a senior polish banker was quoted as saying.
    wladyslaw baka, head of poland's national bank, told the
official news agency pap yesterday the talks were a step
towards possible fresh credits or easier terms.
    ""much attention was given to the polish delegation and the
talks at both institutions involved displayed a lot of
understanding for poland's difficult economic position,"" pap
quoted baka as saying.
    baka said he stressed poland would meet its financial
obligations to the u.s., ""but not in a short time, and not
without major changes in the polish economy as well as a
cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners.""
    since poland rejoined the imf last june, after a 36-year
absence, imf and world bank teams have visited warsaw on
fact-finding missions on at least three occasions. a major
report is expected to be issued in washington soon.
    poland has said it will not be able to meet interest
repayments and debt principle falling due this year.

"<qantas airways ltd> has placed a firm
order with boeing co <ba> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost
of 250 mln australian dlrs each, chairman jim leslie said.
    the first is due for delivery in april 1989 with the others
arriving in may, june and september of that year, he said in a
statement.
    the 400 series is the latest model of the boeing 747
family, he said.
    the purchase will take government-owned qantas's 747 fleet
to 28, he said.
    leslie said qantas is talking to three engine makers who
are all offering engines for the boeing 747-400 and it will
announce a decision on engine purchases later this year.
    he said they are united technologies corp <utx> unit <pratt^m

    he said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such
as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced
electronics, should have its first flight next february. the
400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms
further than the current qantas 747-300's, he said.
    the aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and
foreign exchange earnings, and qantas believes they will pay
for themselves in four to five years, leslie said.
    the 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up
from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel
saving, he said.
    the higher range and payload means they will first be used
on the route to britain and europe via asia.
    they will also be used on non-stop flights between sydney

"saudi crude oil output last month fell
to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in january, gulf oil sources said.
    they said exports from the ras tanurah and ju'aymah
terminals in the gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in january because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    but the drop was much smaller than expected after gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of february to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    the production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for opec purposes.
    saudi arabia has an opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last december to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    the sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift february
entitlements before the month-end.
    last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official opec prices from saudi arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of aramco, the sources said.
    the four -- exxon corp <xon>, mobil corp <mob>, texaco inc
<tx> and chevron corp <chv> -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    however the sources said the real test of saudi arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below opec levels.
    saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the december opec accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    the sources said total saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in february to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
january because of cuts at the yanbu and jubail export
refineries.
    they put crude oil exports through yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in january, while throughput at
bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady

plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the
national association of securities dealers automated quotation
system (nasdaq) in the u.s. and on london's stock exchange
automated quotation system, banking sources said.
    the ses is discussing the idea with the london and new york
authorities. gordon macklin, president of the national
association of securities dealers in washington, said he was
very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end
of this month.
    monetary authority of singapore (mas) sources told reuters
they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems
on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local
financial support for the plan existed.
    macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the
three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with singapore filling
a gap when no trading takes place.
    a small group of selected stocks would be used at the start
of three-centre trading to determine investor interest.
    the singapore, london and new york authorities have agreed
in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and
transfer information among the different time zones, but some
details still have to be worked out, a senior singapore bank
director said.
    questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy
sufficient capital in singapore to ensure adequate market
liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.
    but if agreement is reached, singapore will have a head
start over the other asian financial centres in hong kong,
toyko and australia, he said.
    on february 18 the ses created the stock exchange of
singapore dealing and automated quotation system (sesdaq),
modelled on nasdaq.
    at present sesdaq is trading the shares of only one
company, the government-owned singapore national printers ltd
(snp), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small
firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.
    market sources expect the next few companies listed will

corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from april 1, to bring japanese firms back
to the tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    ""relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets,"" a nikko securities house bond manager said.
    securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.

among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in april, with the projected issue by <nippon

    the so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    the four major japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    the new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late december by advisers to finance minister kiichi miyazawa.
they were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    the finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in january to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from march 1, securities managers said.
    the cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    the bond market committee of the securities exchange
council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    it also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. a shelf registration system
would need a revision of japanese commercial law, expected in

over an option held by nobel industrier sweden ab to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in swedish match.
    thre wallenbergs paid nobel industrier <nobl st>, in which
penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the swedish match option, the statement said.
    swedish match's b shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on friday. the a shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    the statement said the deal increased investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in swedish match.
    the wallenbergs' stake in swedish match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    the swedish match deal will cost the wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    the wallenbergs originally sold nobel industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to penser in 1984 to pay for buying volvo
<volv st> out of two other key group companies, atlas copco
<asts st> and stora koppabergs <skps st>.
    since then, the wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in skf (skfr st> by skanska ab <skbs st> and

electrical engineering firm asea ab <asea st> is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe

tomorrow for talks, banking sources said.
    ""we're not very enthusiastic about nigeria's debt
rescheduling,"" said a senior official at a leading japanese
bank.
    a team of nigerian officials will meet with japanese
creditor banks here later this week to seek japanese support
for a proposed refinancing of part of nigeria's 19 billion dlr
foreign debt, bankers said.
    the senior bank official said a majority of japanese bank
creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to nigeria
although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept
rescheduling of part of their existing loans.
    ""the problem is nigeria has so far neglected us japanese
creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the
nation's debt situation,"" said another japanese bank official.
    he said japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent
of western commercial bank exposure to nigeria and were
uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details.
    some 21 japanese banks have loans outstanding to nigeria,
representing about four pct of the credit extended by western
commercial institutions, banking sources said.
    they said nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs
in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 1.4 to 1.5
billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987. japanese
banks want nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as
well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day
meeting here, the sources added.
    ""otherwise, our response will be very negative,"" the senior
official said.
    banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor
banks involved have responded positively to the nigerian debt
proposal.
    bank of japan officials said they hope japanese commercial
banks will help nigeria overcome its debt problems.
    barclays bank plc <bcs.l> has the most exposure to
nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee
looking at the problem, the banking sources said. bankamerica
corp <bac.n> is coordinating private bank creditors in the far

"prime minister yasuhiro nakasone is likely
to leave office this summer amid opposition to his
controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.
    they said nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has
suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct
sales tax planned for january 1988.
    ""nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the
end of his administration, which is not only impossible but
also is very irresponsible as a politican,"" rei shiratori,
professor of politics at dokkyo university, told reuters.
    ""nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as
parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,""
shiratori said.
    some ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) members of
parliament have spoken against the tax, which nakasone says is
needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.
    nakasone today called for disciplinary action against ldp
members who oppose the tax. ""there are some who are objecting
because of their constituencies,"" he told a meeting of
government and party leaders. ""if the party discipline is
broken, i would like to see punishment considered.""
    ""a proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly
because nakasone breached his election pledge against
introducing it,"" shiratori said.
    ""moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels
uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's
appreciation and about the future when the japanese society is
rapidly aging,"" he said.
    political analysts said the controversial tax could affect
the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for april,
involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and
assemblies at all levels.
    but the situation is complicated, since opposition parties
excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with
the ldp, the political analysts added.
    shiratori said, ""in the worst case, implementation of the
sales tax, now scheduled for next january, may be put off for
some time before the government makes a final decision.
    ""another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to
perhaps three pct.
    ""a third alternative for the government is to ram through
the bills only with the attendance of ldp mps,"" he said.
    seizaburo sato, professor of politics at tokyo university,
thought the last possibility most likely. ""i think the ldp alone
will take a vote on the tax bills,"" he said.
    the ldp now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat lower house and
143 in the 252-seat upper house.
    to lure opposition parties back to parliament after the ldp
pushes through the tax bills, the nakasone cabinet will have to
resign, sato said.
    ""boycotting opposition members will be more willing to
return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed,"" he said.

    dat players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. they use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    this aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. in negotiations that delayed the
dat player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    machines sold in japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. but copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.

countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. but japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.

growing increasingly irritated with each other.
    the talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
whole gamut of u.s./japan economic relations, will pave the way
for american secretary of state george schultz's one day
stop-over here at end-week on his way home from china.
    faced with growing congressional protectionist pressure,
the u.s. administration is pressing japan for speedy action to
reduce its still huge trade surplus, u.s. officials said.
    ""we appreciate their frustration,"" a senior japanese
government official said. ""but we are also frustrated.""
    the official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
18 months has hit japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
that has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
but it will, he said.
    he said the u.s. administration was ignoring the progress
that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
remain when it talks with congress.
    ""it would only take five minutes to list their
accomplishments,"" a senior u.s. official replied.
    the talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
billion dlrs in japan's favour.
    on the following two days, the topics will range from
multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the general
agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) to such bilateral trade
problems as super computers.
    the structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
discussions among senior officials. tomorrow's topics include
savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
    these talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
    some u.s. officials complained japan has no intention of
boosting domestic demand and imports, as washington wants.
    japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
u.s. budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
imbalance. that budget deficit has meant that the u.s. is
buying more imports.
    japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
trade bill before the senate as a nation following adverserial
trade practices. ""it condemns japan without due process,"" one

bill introduced by democratic senator lloyd bentsen, he said.

trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
action by the u.s., officials said.
    nevertheless, japanese officials said they remain in a weak
bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
overhanging them.

a senior economic planner said.
    wang chao-ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic
planning and development, told reuters taiwan would further
reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second
half of this year.
    cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and
wang said further cuts would go much deeper.
    ""we have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs
faster and more substantially,"" he said.
    the united states, taiwan's main trading partner, has said
the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of
almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. it has criticised the cuts as
too selective.
     taiwan's trade surplus with the united states hit 13.6
billion dlrs last year. the surplus has boosted foreign
exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which wang said made
taiwan a target for u.s. protectionism.

taiwan's position in talks with washington over export quotas,
particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are
among the island's main export-earners.

pct in february from 55.8 pct in january, the napm said. it was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    a reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. one below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    the report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers

rate in new orders and production slowed in february.

    vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as u.s. steel <x>
gradually resumed production.
    an equal number of members reported inventories were higher
and lower. the napm said that had not happened since august
1984.

"brazil would not have suspended
payments on debt owed to foreign banks if it had received more
and faster financing from official lending agencies, finance
minister dilson funaro said.
    he said he would not seek more money from the international
monetary fund to which brazil paid 922 mln dlrs last year and
said brazil's problems could not be solved by imf intervention.
    ""it's a question of why the official lending agencies don't
finance a little bit more quickly and easily,"" funaro told
reporters at the brazilian embassy.
    asked if brazil would have continued making payments of
monthly interest to its foreign commercial bank lenders if
official lending agencies had provided more funds, he replied,
""yes, because our country did not receive financing from these
agencies.""
    asked how long the payment suspension would last, funaro
said ""it all depends on what kind of financing we are going to
receive from the other side.""
    brazil, with foreign debt totaling 108 billion dlrs,
stunned the banking community last week by suspending payments
on some 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks.
    funaro said brazil had paid 44 billion dollars to the world
bank and other lending agencies and commercial banks in the
past four years and got only 11 billion dlrs in loans.
    he said the net transfer was hurting the country's
continued growth and capacity to import goods.
    ""something is wrong with the system. some mechanism has to
be found to finance a country like brazil,"" funaro said.
    he did not specify what steps he had in mind but said he
would like to see ""automatic"" official lending when needed so
that brazil would not have to dip into its dwindling reserves,
now reported to be below four billion dlrs.
    funaro said brazil had the world's third-largest trade
surplus and estimated the 1987 surplus would be at least eight
billion dlrs.
    but he said that without increased and faster lending from
official institutions, the nation could not rely on its export
earnings to finance development and imports and also service
its debt.
    ""we must find an equilibrium between foreign adjustment and
internal adjustment,"" funaro said.
    he complained that official lending agencies had imposed
tight control on credit over the past four years, leaving
commercial bank refinancing as the only credit available.
    funaro said u.s officials understand his position ""but they
don't like it."" later he left washington for a tour of europe
and debt discussions with officials in britain, west germany,
france, switzerland and italy.

"american express co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of shearson lehman brothers inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    in a joint statement, american express and shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
american express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    american express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    last week, rumors circulated on wall street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a japanese firm. analysts said the
speculation also focused on american express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    there was some speculation that american express had also
considered a total spinoff of shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     american express said in the statement on sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. the company also remained
silent last thursday and friday, as rumors drove american
express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a friday close at 74.
     it said it issued the statement on sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
american express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    some analysts said american express may consider spinning
off part of shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of american express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    american express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of shearson would bring. analysts speculated that all of
shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    to some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
""(american) express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to,"" said larry eckenfelder of
prudential-bache securities.
    analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
shearson management wednesday. chief operating officer jeffrey
lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     the reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow shearson to be a stand alone company.
     analysts, contacted on sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. it does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    late last year, shearson's takeover offer to the e.f.
hutton group inc was rejected by hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major wall street brokerage.

    hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of pc
acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the pc courier subsidiary. hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on friday.
while some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    this follows sales of two other purolator units. it agreed
recently to sell its canadian courier unit to onex capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    purolator retains its stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. a hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on stant.
    purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
u.s. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    e.f. hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. this so-called ""bridge"" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, hutton said. hutton lbo is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president warren idsal said.
    ""purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to u.s. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. we belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future,"" said idsal.

division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    the tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    the offer will begin thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the interstate commerce commission and will expire

"the u.s. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    ""it is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks,"" said anthony
dub, who heads first boston corp's asset-backed group.
    bankamerica corp's <bac> bank of america unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager first boston. dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    the bank of america offering followed a january 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by republicbank corp's <rpt>
republicbank delaware unit. goldman, sachs and co ran the books
on that deal, with first boston acting as co-manager.
    however, dub said the bank of america securities were more
closely related to the so-called ""cars deals"" that raced to
market last year than were the republicbank securities.
    ""the republicbank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. in contrast, the bank of america deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle,"" he said.
    in a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    the bank of america certificates were issued by california
credit card trust a, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    the debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. first boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable treasury securities. non-callable for life, the deal
was rated aaa by both moody's and standard and poor's.
    underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
bank of america deal was priced too aggressively. ""aaa-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over treasuries
when first boston priced the deal,"" one said.
    however, dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    the first boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by s and p alone.
    ""investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months,"" dub detailed.
    investment bankers pointed out that because the bank of
america deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    the collateral for the trust includes a pool of visa credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. bank of america
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the u.s., analysts said.
    last week's deal was bank of america's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    in mid-december 1986 bank of america sold, via california
cars grantor trust 1986-a, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through salomon brothers inc.
    upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of volvo 1986 lease finance corp, a
unit of volvo finance north america inc, via first boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of mack trucks
receivables corp, a unit of mack trucks inc <mack>, via
shearson lehmand brothers inc.
    the asset backed market, which began in march 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

"after a week that left his presidency
shaken and his popularity at a new low, ronald reagan and his
new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an
administration tattered by the iran-contra arms scandal.
    reagan and former senate republican leader howard baker,
whose appointment as white house chief of staff won bipartisan
praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing
criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade u.s. arms with
iran for help in freeing ameican hostages in lebanon.
    among the chores facing reagan's new inner circle is
assessing the damage the 300-page tower commission report has
done to the nomination of robert gates to succeed william casey
as the new head of the central intelligence agency.
    white house officials are checking to see how much support
gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have
if his nomination is submitted to the full senate for a vote,
senate republican leader robert dole said.
    appearing on the nbc news program, ""meet the press,"" the
kansas senator said the gates nomination ""could be in some
difficulty.""
    aides said that gates' future would be given high priority
by baker.
    even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale
scandal, lawmakers said senate confirmation of the gates
nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only
after months of congressional probes into the affair.
    ""he has the smell of iran on him,"" said former nevada sen.
and reagan confidant paul laxalt. ""he is a victim.""
    laxalt, appearing on the abc news program, ""this week with
david brinkley,"" bluntly admitted ""the gates nomination is in
trouble."" senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn said
the odds are now slightly against confirmation of gates.
    when asked on the syndicated television program, ""john
mclaughlin: one on one,"" if he thought gates would be confirmed,
the georgia democrat shot back: ""i wouldn't bet any money on it.
    ""i think this report hurts that,"" nunn said. ""it indicates
that the national security council had policy-type influence
over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into
that with mr. gates.
    only a day after it was issued last week, the tower report
prompted the abrupt exit of donald regan as white house chief
of staff.
    regan, the former wall street executive and treasury
secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past
two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the
botched handling of the iran arms sale.
    the report blamed regan for the ""chaos that descended on the
white house"" since it was first revealed last november that
profits from the iran arms sales had been diverted to contra
rebels fighting the leftist nicaraguan government.
    the two other victims of the scandal are former national
security adviser vice adm. john poindexter who resigned and
marine lt. col. oliver north who was fired after it was
disclosed last november 23 that profits from the iran arms sale
were diverted to the contras. the two, pictured by the tower
commission as the key operators of the iran arms deal, have
refused to testify.
    reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed
in the tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose
inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.
    that perception has wrecked reagan's popularity and
threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves
office in january 1989. a recent newsweek magazine poll found
that just 40 pct of americans approved of reagan's leadership,
a record low, and a third believed he should consider
resignation.
    after meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over
the meaty report of the commission headed by former texas sen.
john tower, reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television
address this week to respond to the criticisms of his
presidency.

"brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, finance minister dilson funaro said.
    u.s. banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding ""this is not fair with the european and japanese banks.""
the committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    noting the often different reactions of u.s., japanese and
european banks, funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, ""perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors,"" central bank president francisco gros said.
    brazil on february 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in
washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit britain, france, west
germany, switzerland and italy for discussions with
governments.
    funaro and gros are today meeting british chancellor of the
exchequer nigel lawson, foreign secretary geoffrey howe and
governor of the bank of england robin leigh-pemberton.
    bankers have estimated that brazil owes u.k. banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the u.k.
the third largest exposure after the u.s. and japan.
    the crisis began when brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country'sate of inflation.  reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.
    funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems
with brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only
partial servicing of the debt.
    ""what we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance
for part of the service, because we cannot service all that,"" he
said. ""i really think we have to change the old rules.""
    asked why brazil was first approaching governments, rather
than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a
solution to the crisis, funaro said ""we must first talk to the
governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the
banks have some limits.""
    ""it is a political discussion from our point of view,"" he
said.
    funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to
japanese and canadian government officials. he would then talk
to the commercial banks ""if i've got some solution from the
governments. i can't take the burden only to the banks."" he was
not sure how long it would take to reach a solution.
   in discussions with governments brazil would review the
mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in
need. finance from official lending agencies had been virtually
closed since 1982. ""you must open these mechanisms,"" he said.
    he said that while the u.s. officials had been disturbed by
brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood
brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.
    also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed ""because
we can't stay as we were the last few years.""
    ""i'm trying to put the problem on the table.... all of us
would like to have a kind of equilibrium."" he said. although
brazil has rejected a substantive role for the international
monetary fund (imf) in managing its economy, funaro paid a call
in washington to imf managing director michel camdessus and to
world bank president barber conable.
    funaro noted that inflation in february had started to
decline again and he expected brazil to achieve a minimum eight
billion dlr trade surplus in 1987.
    banking sources noted that brazil's monthly surplus had
declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last
year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.
    brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,
funaro said, although its share of international trade was only
one pct.  ""the solution is linked with growth, not recession,"" he
said, noting an imf program would involve promoting exports and
inducing an internal recession in order to service debt.
    banking sources said brazil's debts to foreign governments,
as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder
structure following last month's rescheduling by the paris club
of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

"u.k. chancellor of the exchequer nigel
lawson has told brazil's finance minister dilson funaro that
negotiations on brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter
for the commercial banks themselves, a treasury spokesman said.
    the spokesman said the chancellor had emphasised in talks
this morning with funaro the need for the brazilian authorities
to be able to present a convincing economic program to the
country's creditors. he added an accord with the international
monetary fund (imf) could be a very helpful support.
    brazil on february 20 suspended interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks.
    lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a
clear rebuff to brazilian hopes of obtaining official
cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis.
    funaro, accompanied by central bank president francisco
gros, is on the first leg of a tour of european capitals in an
attempt to explain to governments brazil's indefinite
suspension of interest payments earlier this month.
    brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the
imf in managing its economy, arguing that an imf austerity
program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption
would lead to recession and threaten democracy.
    funaro and gros last week visited washington as part of
their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts
to change the means by which developing countries finance
growth.
    funaro said on saturday in washington that brazil would not
have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and
faster financing from international agencies.
    he said earlier today that brazil was first approaching
governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves
about the interest payment moratorium ""because the banks have
some limits.... it's a political discussion from our point of
view.""
    funaro said on friday that his talks with u.s. officials
had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve
brazil's debt crisis, describing the meeting as an initial
contact.
    he had earlier met federal reserve board chairman paul
volcker and u.s. treasury secretary james baker.
    the treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had
been at funaro's request.
    after travelling this week to france, germany, switzerland
and italy, funaro hopes to visit canada and japan next week
before starting negotiations with banks.

"investor sumner redstone, who leads
one of the two groups vying for control of viacom international
inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    in a filing with the securities and exchange commission,
redstone, who controls dedham, mass.,-based national amusements
inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    the redstone offer, which is being made through arsenal
holdings inc, a national amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from redstone and mcv holdings inc, a group led by viacom
management which is competing with redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with viacom.
    the company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    the redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    the two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    in his sec filing, redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said bank of
america is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, bank of america has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
redstone said.
    merrill lynch, pierce fenner and smith inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, redstone said.
    redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    the redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    the new offer, the second sweetened deal redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

"a study group said the united states
should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln
barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact
of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry.
    u.s. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750
mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect the
economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise.
    the aspen institute for humanistic studies, a private
group, also called for new research for oil exploration and
development techniques.
    it predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a
barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, with
imports at about 30 pct of u.s. consumption.
    the study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: to
protect the u.s. industry through an import fee or other such
device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil.
    but the group did not strongly back either option, saying
there were benefits and drawbacks to both.
    it said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves
and more exploration and development research would help to
guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports.

"directors of the chicago mercantile
exchange will meet wednesday to consider a membership petition
asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading
activities in the widely-popular standard and poor's 500 stock
index futures pit, an exchange executive said.
    the petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal
practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade
for their own account.
    but exchange officials noted this practice also provides an
opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called
""front-running"", where traders enter orders for their own account
before executing orders for their customers.
    leo melamed, cme special counsel, said directors will rule
on the petition on wednesday, but added that a special s and p
advisory committee has been studying s and p 500 futures
trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to
submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.
    in addition to a recommendation on dual trading, melamed
said the special committee will also make suggestions about a
possible automatic order entry and execution system for s and p
500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would
alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.
    melamed said directors are likely to approve the
recommendations of the special committee because ""most actions
of the board are in line with committee recommendations.""
    cme senior vice president gerald beyer said if the board
accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be
submitted to the commodity futures trading commission for
approval.
    if the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,
a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership
for a vote within 15 days, beyer said.
    melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on
before the recommendations from the special committee are made
""it will confuse the issue.""
    not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict
dual trading.
    although jonathan wolff, senior vice president at donaldson
lufkin and jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most
exchanges.
    ""it's a question of the integrity of the person you do
business with,"" wolff said.
    futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that
trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up
for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in
chaotic futures trading pits.
    ""to have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult
for a broker to function because of his errors,"" said john
michael, vice president at first options of chicago.
    ""what it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,""
he said.
    furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage
makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.
    ""if i ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or
even suspected him of doing it, i would cut him off,"" michael
said.
    an average broker in the treasury bond futures pit, for
instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day
at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.  even figuring
what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such
brokerage can be lucrative.
    front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of
an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the
brokerage business, michael said.

securities fraud in connection with its july 1983 default on
2.25 billion dlrs of bonds, a wppss official told reuters.

sec staff attorneys that the five sec commissioners would be
asked to charge wppss in connection with its official
statements about its plans to build its no. 3 and no. 4 nuclear
power plants in the pacific northwest at the time it was

the costs,"" he said.

language of the message was not totally clear and some believed
shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the soviet

"the new york mercantile exchange set
april one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     on april one, nymex will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    ""this will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world,"" said said thomas mckiernan, mckiernan and co chairman.
    foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against nymex
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to nymex prices, mckiernan explained.
     the expanded program ""will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when nymex does,"" said frank capozza,
secretary of century resources inc.
     the rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on nymex, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in u.s. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or efp, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an efp and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    when nymex announced its proposed rule change in december,
nymex president rosemary mcfadden, said, ""expansion of the efp
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading.""

"a bidding war for viacom international
inc, one of the largest u.s. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against national
amusements inc, a closely held theater operator.
    both sides raised their bids over the weekend. a source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. he said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. ""it would take 20
days from the day we mail,"" said the source.
    the source predicted national amusements, controlled by
investor sumner redstone, would need ""half a year"" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    redstone was not available for comment.
    some of wall street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. one
said redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    the independent directors of viacom were called into a
meeting today. word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. one
major wall street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""we think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    both redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. the
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of arsenal holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured viacom. one arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. the arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
april 30 that a merger with arsenal is not consummated. the
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during may and 12 pct thereafter. previously redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    other arbitrageurs said both redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive terrence elkes,
were offering high prices. ""redstone really wants to own the
company,"" one said. another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov viacom's 35 mln shares.
    a wall street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. he
noted as an example that new stock in fmc corp <fmc>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    last week, viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. the company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    shares of warner communications inc <wci> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. analysts noted warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    chris craft industries <ccn>, which owns a stake in warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from cbs inc <cbs>.

nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. it is one of the largest distributors of films

"canada's decision to raise the issue
of a free trade pact with the u.s. was a sign of what many see
as a new spirit of canadian self-confidence, a public policy
study group said 
    ""it suggests the canada of the immediate post-war period,
when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar
world,"" the washington-based atlantic council said.
    u.s. and canadian negotiators opened talks last summer
aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries,
the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments
of about 150 billion dlrs annually.
    the council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline
of october for an agreement, are the biggest issue in
u.s.-canadian relations.
   the study said liberalized trade between the two countries
would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world
markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.
    the council said ""in the past most canadians have shied away
from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be
overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer
association with a country 10 times their size in population.""
    but at the same time, it added, canadians realized their
domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and
sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an
increasingly competitive world.
    the council said that in the talks, canada is chiefly
interested in minimizing the imposing of u.s. duties against 
allegedly subsidized exports.
    a recent example was the 15 per cent duty the u.s. imposed
on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being
subsidized.
    the council said the chief u.s. concerns included ending
curbs against u.s. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and
the so-called ""cultural industries"" - publishing, broadcasting
and films.
    it said other major u.s.-canadian issues were defense
cooperation, ""acid rain"" and the u.s. rejection of a canadian
assertion of sovereignty over waters of the northwest passage.

"imperial chemical industries plc, the
largest chemical company in the united kingdom, will expand its
specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better
its 1986 results, said chairman-elect denys henderson.
    ""we expect to shift our company toward higher value-added
businesses and continue to broaden our base,"" henderson told
reporters at an informal meeting here.
    ici today announced the formation of a new u.s.
drug company, ici pharma, which, with its stuart
pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current
pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.
    henderson said, ""our pharmaceutical business gets lost in
the way that glaxo's (glaxo holdings plc) does not.""
    ici's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug
maker behind glaxo in the u.k. last year u.s. drug sales were
about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,
which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.
    he estimated that by 1990, ici's pharmaceutical division
would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.
    ""the drug division far and away brings in the highest rate
of return,"" said a.w. clements, finance director of ici, who
was also at the meeting.
    henderson said the new u.s. drug concern would basically
act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs
to doctors. ici will hire 145 new salespeople by october one.
    henderson said the major new products in the company's
pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs
annually, were statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,
zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and carwin,
a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
    henderson said u.s. food and drug administration approval
to market statil and zoladex, both under joint licensing
agreements with merck and co inc <mrk>, is not expected until
about 1989. ici expects to file for permission to market carwin
in the u.s. later this year.
    henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986
income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per adr on sales of 15
billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.
    henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by glidden
paints, which ici bought last november for 580 mln dlrs from a
unit of hanson industries inc.
    henderson also said that ici has about nine billion dlrs
available for acquisitions. last year the company made 40
acquisitions, the largest being glidden. he said that more
acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an
acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as ""too expensive.""
    henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective
april one when he takes over from sir john harvey-jones who
will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the
earnings momentum ici has established over the past few years
after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

"brazilian finance minister dilson funaro
flatly rejected a u.k. suggestion that his country seek
international monetary fund help in order to facilitate debt
negotiations with commercial creditor banks.
    talking to reporters, funaro said this attitude would not
help resolve the crisis started when brazil suspended
indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external
debt on february 20.
    funaro was in britain on the first leg of a tour of
european capitals to explain the motives of the brazilian debt
moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve
capital flows between developed countries and third world
debtor nations.
   talking before his departure for paris, he said there could
be no question of brazil adopting another imf austerity plan
after a similar package four years ago ""put brazil in a very big
recession.""
    ""we had an imf program - it simply meant export more and
import less. we are not going to go the imf,"" he said.
    funaro was reactnng to a british statement following his
talks with chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson, saying the
u.k. government had no part to play in what it viewed as a
problem between brazil and its commercial creditor banks.
    britain also believed an imf program would help along
negotiations between brazil and the commercial banks, the
statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright
rebuttal of all brazilian demands, said.
    ""that was not my impression of the meeting,"" funaro said; ""but
if the (british) answer is more or less like this, then
that means nothing is helping to find a solution.""
    funaro stressed that his talks in washington last week and
in europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to
unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to
deal with brazils ties with commercial banks.
    ""since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my
country,"" he said.
    he said lawson had made no commitments to support brazil's
efforts. lawson would officially state his position when the
two meet again next month for the imf and world bank spring
meetings in washington, funaro said.
    stressing there was no binding time schedule for brazil's
debt problem to be resolved, funaro said brazil had not come to
europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis.
    ""we didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme,"" he said,
""we will have meetings at the imf next month - let's see what
happens.""
    neither did brazil plan a major overhaul of current
domestic economic policies, which funaro said would likely lead
to a five pct economic growth this year.
    ""over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and
received 11 billion ... this is a very big effort,"" he said.
""what we have to offer is our cooperation.""

"all major grain producing countries
must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
recent australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two u.s.
wheat organizations said.
    the recent australian proposals were a good starting point
for discussions, ""but we do not want the australians to feel
they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world
grain trade, the president of the national association of wheat
growers, nawg, and the chairman of u.s. wheat associates said
in a letter to u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng and u.s.
trade representative clayton yeutter.
    future discussions on international wheat trade should
include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the u.s.
have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
two organizations said 
    while the australian proposals are welcome the two
organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
assessments.
    australia's proposals, which aim to reduce u.s. target
prices and ""quarantine"" u.s. wheat stocks, would continue to
place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on u.s.
farmers, they said.
      other countries, including australia, have benefitted
from the higher world prices that have resulted from past u.s.
acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
    ""we will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" jim
miller, president of nawg said.

world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and

has had discussions with several american medical international
inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
company.
    pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
takeover bid for american medical with several large
shareholders, including the biggest investor, the bass family
of texas. however, the bass family has not indicated support
one way or the other for his offer, he said.
    pesch, in an interview with reuters, said based on the
conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
whether he had majority support. he said, however, there is
support for his offer.
    pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
discussions other than the bass family and the wedge group inc,
the only other holder of more than five pct of american medical
stock.
    earlier today, wedge group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
said it held discussions with pesch, american medical
management and other american medical shareholders.
    wedge, in a filing with the securities and exchange
commission, said it believes a restructuring of american
medical and its business would be ""highly desirable and
appropriate at this time.""
    ""that's the sort of position that i find a large segment of
shareholders of ami really share,"" said pesch.
    pesch said he held discussions with wedge about joining his
takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
american medical share. wedge said it has no plans to join in
an effort to seek control of american medical, but it would not
rule out a future takeover try.
    pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
with the bass family.
    some analysts saw the wedge statement as a boost to pesch's
takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
shareholder dissatisfaction following american medical's
previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
pesch.
    american medical is expected to resist pesch's latest bid.
larry feinberg, an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said a
management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
    an american medical spokesman said the company will comment
on the new pesch offer by march 10.
    analysts continue to view the bass family as a factor in
the outcome of the bid for control of american medical.
    the bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in american
medical, and the company has previously said the investors
support management's internal plan to improve the company's
performance. the bass family would not comment on american
medical or pesch.
    pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of republic health corp
last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on wall
street because of the long time it took to finish the republic
acquisition.
    republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
much larger american medical takeover proposal.
    pesch's first offer for american medical was made without
an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to wall
street. however, pesch entered his second offer with
representation from donaldson, lufkin, and jenrette securities
and security pacific merchant banking group.
    ""i don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
environment,"" pesch said.
    pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
arrangements are being made. he did say if he succeeds in
acquiring american medical he plans to keep much of american
medical management in place.
    he said he plans to combine the company with republic to
form an efficient network of hospitals.
    analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
be made for american medical.
    byron nimocks of e.f. hutton group said improved second
fiscal quarter earnings could make american medical stock worth
about 20 dlrs per share.
    nimocks estimates american medical earnings for the second
quarter ended february 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
loss last year.
    nimocks said pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
    but feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
could be completed because of the revised structure of the
offer. ""i think it's much more doable,"" he said.
    analysts have said american medical has begun a turnaround
by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

"brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, finance minister dilson funaro said.
    u.s. banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding ""this is not fair with the european and japanese banks.""
the committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    noting the often different reactions of u.s., japanese and
european banks, funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, ""perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors,"" central bank president francisco gros said.
    brazil on february 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in
washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit britain, france, west
germany, switzerland and italy for discussions with
governments.
    funaro and gros are today meeting british chancellor of the
exchequer nigel lawson, foreign secretary geoffrey howe and
governor of the bank of england robin leigh-pemberton.
    bankers have estimated that brazil owes u.k. banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the u.k.
the third largest exposure after the u.s. and japan.
    the crisis began when brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country'rate of inflation.  reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.

    analysts and some wall street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with hutton friday.

had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on

might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with hutton was struck friday.
    hutton had been in talks with purolator's adviser, dillon,
read and co since late december, a hutton spokesman said.
    hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. if all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of pc acquisition containing the purolator u.s.
courier operation. hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    wall street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with hutton. the sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.

impact on american soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion

ec obligations under the gatt.

of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine
made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine,
and closer in price to expensive european butter.

"last week's white house shake-up has
increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul
volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the fed say.
    but they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this august, has been taken by the white house
and volcker too has not made up his mind.
    former white house chief of staff donald regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to
ensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president
carter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan.
    only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration,
vice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker,
kept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    sources close to the administration say regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace volcker.
    but as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    the sources said new white house chief of staff howard
baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the
fed chairmanship.
    as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to volcker.
    ""this new white house is going to need all the strength it
can get,"" said one source when asked about the possibility of
volcker's reappointment.
    paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the united states and around the world. at a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely
undermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury
secretary baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the treasury position.
    and a recent statement by a reagan administration official
that the two men saw ""exactly eye-to-eye"" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman.
    baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's
reappointment to the fed in mid-1983.
    the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed
treasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first
term, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm
merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to
stay. ""is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise,"" said one. ""he'd have to be asked,"" said stephen
axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed
and now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international.
    otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years.
    many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of
state george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary
under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran
scandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    other potential candidates include economist alan
greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal
deposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel.
    long a regan protege, sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the white house.

"the government's industry aid and
protection review body, the industries assistance commission
(iac), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the australian wheat
industry, primary industry minister john kerin said.
    the iac has been asked to report on the need for assistance
to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid,
he said in a statement.
    he said the inquiry will be the first step in setting
marketing arrangements to apply after june 30, 1989, when the
underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 wheat marketing
act expire.
    kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full
examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.
    ""the inquiry will be required to take into account changes
which have taken place in the industry as a result of the
agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and
the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,""
he said.
    ""the inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry,
as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger
underwriting support from the government for the first time,"" he
said.
    kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the
guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the australian
wheat board near the start of the season.
    the iac's report will be due at the same time as the
findings of the current royal commission into grain storage,
handling and transport, kerin said.
    he said the timing of the iac inquiry would allow its
findings and those of the royal commission to be considered in
later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the
federal and state governments and the industry.

"the failure of the international coffee
organization (ico) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas
could trigger a massive selloff in london coffee futures of at
least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.
    prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80
cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.
    a special meeting between importing and exporting countries
ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks
over how to set the quotas. no further meeting to discuss
quotas was set, delegates said.
    quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the
international coffee agreement, were suspended a year ago after
prices soared following a damaging drought in brazil.
    with no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer
selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee
roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.
    lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket
shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.
    the u.s. and brazil, the largest coffee importer and
exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the
breakdown of the talks.
    jon rosenbaum, u.s. assistant trade representative and
delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council
adjourned, ""a majority of producers, led by brazil, were not
prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective
criteria.
    ""we want to insure that countries receive export quotas
based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their
political influence in the ico.""
    brazilian coffee institute (ibc) president jorio dauster
countered, ""negotiations failed because consumers tried to
dictate quotas, not negotiate them.""
    previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts
exported, which gave brazil a 30 pct share of a global market
of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. a majority of producers wanted
quotas to continue under this basic scheme.
    but most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers
proposed carving up the export market on the basis of
exportable production and stocks, which would reduce brazil's
share to 28.8 pct.
    consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes
in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more
readily available to consumers when they need it.
    a last-minute attempt by colombia, the second largest
exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim
proposal could not bring the two sides together.
    delegates speculated brazil's financial problems,
illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on
bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to
protect its coffee export earnings.
    developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily
on coffee earnings, particularly some african nations and
colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ico's failure
to agree quotas, analysts said.
    the expected drop in prices could result in losses of as
much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates
forecast.
    the ico executive board will meet march 31, but the full
council is not due to meet again until september, delegates
said.

"japanese investor interest in british
gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations
sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices, and

    japanese, british and u.s. securities houses have been
expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors
seeking capital gains, including city and trust banks, which
have been active on the u.s. treasury market, they said.
    dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has
been getting stronger, the general manager of the local office
of a british securities firm said.
    on the other hand, major long-term investors such as
japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about
buying british securities ahead of the march 31 close of the
japanese financial year, traders said.
    these investors, who must convert yen into sterling through
dollars for british securities purchases, appear to be buying
in london rather than in tokyo, a bond manager for a british
securities house said.
    the sterling/yen rate was about 240.34/44 today, up from
234.50 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of
230 to 234 late last year.
    many bond traders in tokyo are doubtful that sterling will
further appreciate steeply. however, gilts may benefit from

from brokers here,"" said laurie milbank and co assistant manager

"japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
january's three pct record, senior economists, including susumu
taketomi of industrial bank of japan, said.
    december's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's management and coordination agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    ""there is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment,"" said takashi kiuchi, senior economist for
the long-term credit bank of japan ltd.
    the government, which published the january unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    ""at present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving,"" a labour ministry official said.
    finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in april.
    prime minister yasuhiro nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    the yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said koichi tsukihara, deputy general manager of sumitomo bank
ltd's economics department.
    however, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.
    the economists said the service sector should grow as the
government stimulates domestic demand under its program to
transform the economy away from exports.
    although japanese unemployment rates appear lower than
those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating
statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.
    ""the three pct figure  could translate into a relatively
high figure if european methods were used,"" one economist said.
more than half of january's 170,000 increase in jobless from a
year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, sumitomo's

"central bank governor chang chi-cheng
rejected a request by textile makers to halt the rise of the
taiwan dollar against the u.s. dollar to stop them losing
orders to south korea, hong kong and singapore, a spokesman for
the taiwan textile federation said.
    he quoted chang as telling representatives of 19 textile
associations last saturday the government could not fix the
taiwan dollar exchange rate at 35 to one u.s. dollar due to
u.s. pressure for an appreciation of the local currency.
    the federation asked the government on february 19 to hold
the exchange rate at that level.
    the federation said in its request that many local textile
exporters were operating without profit and would go out of
business if the rate continued to fall.
    it said the taiwan dollar has risen almost 14 pct against
the u.s. dollar since september 1985 while the south korean won
climbed only four pct. the singapore and hong kong dollars
remained stable against the u.s. unit in that period, it said.
    many local bankers and economists predict taiwan's dollar
will rise to between 32 and 33 per u.s. dollar by year-end.
    chang was quoted as saying this would depend on taiwan's
ability to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s. this year.
    the surplus widened to a record 13.6 billion u.s. dlrs in
calendar 1986 from 10.2 billion in 1985, official figures show.
    taiwan's textile exports fell by almost four pct in january
to 562 mln u.s. dlrs from 583 mln in january 1986, the same
figures show.
    textiles are taiwan's second-largest export earner, after
electrical and electronic products.
    textile exports surged to 7.8 billion u.s. dlrs last year
from 6.2 billion in 1985. exports to the u.s. last year were

exports to countries other than the u.s. to preserve a
u.s.-japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major japanese
chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
    a miti spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
authorised exporters.
    trading houses applying for a miti export licence will be
required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
not automatically be denied licences, he said.
    but some industry officials predicted any government
measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
world semiconductor market remained weak.
    u.s. government and industry officials have complained
repeatedly that japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
cost to third countries despite the july agreement.
    japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
low prices in japan and higher prices based on production costs
and set for japanese makers under the agreement.
    the miti spokesman said, ""if the percentage of grey market
is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
distributing their products through their sales network knowing
they will be exported by some means. in that case we will ask
them what they are doing to reduce the figure.""
    miti earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.

international growth had been the main feature of the group's

larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of

in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 525 mln stg while bankers' balnces below target will take
out around 175 mln stg.
    partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
and a fall in note circulation will add some 300 mln stg and 40
mln stg to the system respectively.

"japan looks likely to allow u.s. banks to
conduct securities business here, a move that will probably
cause the barriers separating japanese commercial banks from
brokerage houses to break down, financial analysts said.
    but the timing of the approval remains uncertain, due to
conflicting domestic interests.
    j.p.morgan and co <jpm>, bankers trust new york corp <bt>,
manufacturers hanover corp <mhc> and chemical bank new york
corp <chl> are expected to win approval to conduct securities
business in japan, u.s. bank officials said.
    ""there is no reason for extended delay of approval,"" one
official at a u.s. bank said. the four u.s. banks have been
seeking finance ministry approval for months.
    to date, japan has allowed european banks to do securities
business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries. as japanese
banks can conduct securities business in european countries,
this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for
japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market.
    but if u.s. banks win approval, japanese banks will press
hard for similiar status, since they are not allowed to conduct
securities business in the u.s.
    many u.s. bank officials expect their applications to be
approved before june. but japanese banking sources said the
decision will be delayed until next year. a spokesman for the
finance ministry declined comment.
    u.s. bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on
financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months.
ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in april
or june.
    at the last round of financial negotiations in september,
u.s. officials said japan's commitment to deregulation was
flagging.
    analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously
considering the u.s. request since the u.s. federal reserve
bank of new york approved five new primary government
securities dealers, including two japanese brokerages, last
december.
    they said the ministry will have to approve the u.s.
request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open
to foreigners as those of the u.s.
    analysts said japan has proceeded rapidly with financial
deregulation since 1984, but has not touched upon the clear
division between the securities and banking businesses.
    japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to
protect their interests, but analysts said the banks are
finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional
fields.
    officials of major japanese banks said they will pay
special attention to the ministry's reaction to u.s. bank
requests because approval would accelerate market
liberalization in japan.
    the japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for
their own entry into the domestic securities market.

"early dollar straight eurobond trade was
quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling,
continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current
trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.
    eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by
the extremely ebullient tone of the u.k. government bond market
on a combination of positive u.k. economic fundamentals.
    the dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight
bonds were static in dull trade. a handful of issues showed
signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting
today's release of u.s. leading indicators for january.
    the u.s. data due out this afternoon is expected to be
weak, placing the u.s. unit under renewed pressure and robbing
the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading
impetus, one dollar straight trader said.
    ""it's going to be another tedious day and i can't see how
anybody is going to make any money,"" he said.
    eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of
general sterling euphoria -- with the u.k. currency trading at
six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of
the domestic equity markets.
    eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.
    however, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could
soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals
stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.
    trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued
today due to pre-lenten carnival festivities in west germany.
    there were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting
trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started
the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week.
    frn dealers said paper of u.s. -- and also of canadian --
banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press
reports focussing on their exposure to latin american debt.
    ""(brazilian finance minister dilson) funaro's visit to
europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis
after things had more or less quietened down following the
first shock statements last week,"" one frn specialist said.
    despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight
secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early
features on the primary market.
    these were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by morgan
guaranty ltd for saab scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4
pct.
    the other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 --
for nv nederlandse gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/8 pct, with citicorp investment bank ltd as lead manager.
    dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due
mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.

    ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion

"comalco ltd <cmac.s> said its return
to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium
prices and its withdrawal from a japanese smelter venture.
    it said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
year ended december 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
also aided by lower interest rates on u.s. dollar debt and
greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
    comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
share final, dividend delayed until july 1 to take advantage of
proposed dividend imputation laws.
    this would make five cents for the year against a first and
final of one cent in 1985.
    comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer
from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak australian
dollar had helped earnings.
    withdrawal from the <showa aluminium industries kk> joint
venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the <new zealand
aluminium smelters ltd> project with japan's <sumitomo
aluminium smelting co ltd>, permitting repayments and increases
in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.
    as previously reported comalco's <commonwealth aluminium

goldendale, washington, and port facilities at portland, oregon
to <columbia aluminium corp>.
    comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary
provision for goldendale losses and closure costs but that if
the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the
provision made in the 1986 accounts.

"cra ltd <craa.s> said it expected to
pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
after july 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985.
    the mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln.
    cra said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
to its shareholders. after july 1, dividends will be tax-free
to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid.
    the company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
fiscal year ending june 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, cra said in a statement.
    consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
    despite the higher net earnings, cra said 1986 was a poor
year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
gold producers.
    prices for major metals expressed in real u.s. dollars
declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
    fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
substantial restructuring of japanese industry, cra said.
    world demand for metals is growing slowly. inventories have
steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
but overcapacity continues, cra said.
    turning to contributions to its earnings, cra said
bougainville copper ltd <buva.s> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs
while its share of comalco ltd's <cmac.s> net was 37.8 mln.
    net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs
against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.
    lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in
1985, cra said.
    coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
from 2.8 mln.
    cra's share of earnings from the argyle diamond project
amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
    cra said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
    other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for
closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in
future tax provisions, cra said.
    cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. the
strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.
    cra said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985
mln u.s. dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. this cost 47.0
mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.

"china called on the united states to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    but the u.s. embassy replied that chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the u.s. out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said peking itself would have to persuade
congress to change laws which limit its exports.
     the official international business newspaper today
published china's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of u.s. secretary of state george shultz.
     ""it is extremely important that the u.s. market reduce its
restrictions on chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand chinese
exports,"" the editorial said.
     ""the u.s. should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for chinese goods and admit china
into the generalised system of preference (gsp).
     ""despite easing of curbs on u.s. technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added
     the paper also printed an article by china's commercial
counsellor in its washington embassy, chen shibiao, who said
that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
     he named them as u.s. protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
     the paper also printed a table showing that, since
bilateral trade began in 1972, china has had a deficit every
year except 1972 and 1977. it shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
     a u.s. embassy official said the u.s. did not accept
peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
goods shipped to hong kong and then trans-shipped to u.s. while
u.s. figures are based on country of origin.
     he said that, if china wants to obtain gsp status, it will
have to lobby congress itself to persaude it to amend several
laws which currently prevent peking getting such status.
     the u.s. trade act of 1974 says that to qualify for gsp,
china must be a member of the general agreement of tariffs and
trade (gatt), for which it applied in july 1986, and ""not be
dominated or controlled by international communism.""
     the official said china was well aware of the laws, some
of which date to the anti-communist early 1950's, but that
there is not sufficient political will in the u.s. to change
them.
     china has been the subject of about a dozen cases
involving anti-dumping in the u.s. within the last two years,
which the u.s. side won, he said.
     but, for the first time, china signed last week an
agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
lead the u.s. side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
     another diplomat said willingness to provide such
voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
bilateral trade issues and in peking's application to gatt.
     ""china has the potential to disrupt world markets,
especially in textiles. other gatt countries will be nervous
about china in this respect. but there is a precedent for other
centralled planned economies in gatt,"" the diplomat said.
     poland, czechoslovakia, hungary and romania are members of
gatt but none has china's massive market potential for imports
or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
     in a speech today in the northeast city of dalian, u.s.
secretary of state george shultz said his country welcomed
china's interest in participating in gatt.
     ""the process of chinese accession will not be accomplished
overnight -- the gatt rules were not designed for a large
economy of the chinese type,"" shultz said.
     ""china can play an important role by actively joining gatt
discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
enhance market access for exports worldwide. china can further
develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
benefit from its gatt participation,"" he said.
     the problems facing u.s.-china trade and gatt membership
are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
     in a memorandum backing its application presented to gatt
last month, china said it was gradually reforming its economic
system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance
planning"" and economic levers.
     the diplomat said that, to join gatt, china had much to
do.

stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    the tender was announced last friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    dealers said the bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    but because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    ""i would not be surprised if the bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
    ""they would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer,"" he added.

marks from the system. banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.

"the bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    the tender was announced last friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    dealers said the bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    but because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    ""i would not be surprised if the bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
    ""they would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer,"" he added.
    an earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    banks held 52.0 billion marks on february 27 at the
bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion february reserve requirement.

takeover battle between major shareholders the kadoorie family

brokers said.
    they noted heavy buying in hk hotel shares after an
announcement by evergo's <china entertainment and land
investment co ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of hk
hotels from the firm's deputy chairman david liang for 1.06
billion dlrs. the stock rose 12 h.k. dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
    thomas lau, evergo's executive director, declined comment
on whether the group is seeking a further stake in hk hotels.
but he told reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
from liang as long term investment.
    he said evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
hk hotels.""
    analysts said evergo may be looking for a possible
redevelopment of the peninsula hotel, one of asia's best known
hotels, and another site on hong kong island. both are owned by
hk hotels.
    <lai sun garment co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
pct stake in hk hotels from liang for 530 mln dlrs.
    lau denied any link between china entertainment and lai sun
on their acquisitions of the hk hotels stake.
    ""it is purely coincidence,"" he said.
    but analysts were not so certain, saying that the evergo
group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
up with lai sun garment for a takeover.
    lau also denied any contact with the kadoorie family, which
analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of hk hotels. michael
kadoorie is chairman of hk hotels.
    lau said two representatives of evergo will be nominated to
the hk hotels board.
    a source close to the kadoorie family said the family has
not considered any countermoves so far.
    analysts said it would be difficult for evergo and the
kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
styles.
    ""evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
property developments of hk hotels but that strategy may not
fit the conservative kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
not to be named.
    another analyst noted the price of hk hotels had been
distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
only worth about 50 dlrs a share. the offers by evergo and lai
sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
current trading price.

"last week's white house shake-up has
increased the odds that federal reserve board chairman paul
volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the fed say.
    but they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this august, has been taken by the white house
and volcker too has not made up his mind.
    former white house chief of staff donald regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to
ensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president
carter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan.
    only volcker's key allies in the reagan administration,
vice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker,
kept regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    sources close to the administration say regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace volcker.
    but as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    the sources said new white house chief of staff howard
baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
treasury department and is likely to respect his views on the
fed chairmanship.
    as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to volcker.
    ""this new white house is going to need all the strength it
can get,"" said one source when asked about the possibility of
volcker's reappointment.
    paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the united states and around the world. at a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, volcker's departure would definitely
undermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury
secretary baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the treasury position.
    and a recent statement by a reagan administration official
that the two men saw ""exactly eye-to-eye"" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of baker's support for the fed chairman.
    baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker's
reappointment to the fed in mid-1983.
    the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed
treasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    regan, treasury secretary during president reagan's first
term, was formerly head of wall street's largest brokerage firm
merrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to
stay. ""is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise,"" said one. ""he'd have to be asked,"" said stephen
axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed
and now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international.
    otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years.
    many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of
state george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary
under preesident nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran
scandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    other potential candidates include economist alan
greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal
deposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel.
    long a regan protege, sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the white house.

the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    equitorial also said that as of march one it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
galaxy iii satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  it said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    further, equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for contel corp <ctc> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in december 1988.
    the company said conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of equatorial's rights and obligations under the
galaxy iii transponder lease with <burnham leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    equatorial said it would grant contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    equatorial said its understandings with contel are subject
to equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its galaxy iii transponder lease.
it said it hopes to finalize a contel agreement by april 15.

three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    angus said the recent purchase of chesebrough-pond's inc
<cbm.n> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    however, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    finance director niall fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    the same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
unilever nv's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and unilever
plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
chesebrough was due to be published shortly. however, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    he also declined to say what sort of sum unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for stauffer chemical co, which
operates outside unilever's core activities.
    in the u.s., organic growth from the lipton foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    however, he noted that the u.s. household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its surf detergents.

13 years of trade deficits with the u.s. out of the last 15 are

"the kenyan economy is heading for
difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
too far into deficit, president daniel arap moi said.
    in a speech at the state opening of parliament, moi said
high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
    the same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
1985, he added.
    ""but both these factors are no longer in our favour ... as a
result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
reserves during the year,"" he said.
    the price of coffee, kenya's main source of foreign
exchange, fell in london today to about 94 cents a pound from a
peak of 2.14 dlrs in january 1986.
    crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
    moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
    kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
capital for the first time in its history, he added.
    ""this is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
sources to finance our development,"" he said.

expenditure ... and members of this house will have to take the

    the company said information management products will be
the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business
communications campaign under the threme ""the new vision of
kodak.""
    noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,
kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four
billion dlrs in 1986. ""if the kodak divisions generating those
sales were independent, that company would rank among the top
100 of the fortune 500,"" it pointed out.
    the objective of kodak's ""new vision"" communications
campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's
commitment to the business and industrial sector.
    kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the
information management systems unveilded today --
    -- the kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more
than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).
    - the kodak kims system 5000, a networked information
management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.

that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current
information management systems.
    -- the kodak kims system 4500, a microfilm-based,
computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.

write-once/ready-many-times type its mass memory division will
market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in
1988.
    each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up
to 150, 14-inch optical disks. each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes
of randomly accessible on-line storage. thus, kodak pointed
out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.
    kodak said it will begin deliveries of the kims system 5000
in mid-1987. the open-ended and media-independent system 
allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,
including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,
fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to
sell in the 700,000 dlr range.
    initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk
version which provides data storage and retrieval through a
disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing
2.6 gigabytes.
    kodak said the kims system 3000 is the baseline member of
the family of kims systems. using one or two 12-inch manually
loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs
with deliveries beginning in mid-year.
    the company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with
the more powerful kims system 5000.

software as the system 5000. it will be available in mid-1987

and work rules.
    union procedures, however, require approval by the
firestone section of the union's international policy
committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master
contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.
    the company said the rejection of the oklahoma city package
by union locals at des moines and other locations and the
limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and
off-the-road tires in north america led firestone to conclude
the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would

estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    royal bank said it set its provisions ""given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the north american energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices,"" and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    the bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
january 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    the bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on january 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    in reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman allan
taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.

outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with brazil or their

"the london stock exchange's traded
options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year,
and will more than double the range of options available by the
end of 1988, options committee chairman geoffrey chamberlain
said.
    he told a news conference that more options contracts were
traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's
existence.
    chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts
traded in february this year almost tripled to 53,056 from
19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth
was expected.
    ""we're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of
1988,"" said chamberlain. these would correspond to the eligible
constituents of the ft-se 100 share index.
    chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be
introduced this month. options will be available in sears plc
<sehl.l> from march 4, and in plessey co. plc <plyl.l> from
march 19.
    the london stock exchange is the largest outside the united
states for options trading. forty-five equity options, two
currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an
option on the ftse-100 index are available at present.
    chamberlain said the stock exchange aimed to consolidate
the london options market's leading position in europe,
especially important with french and swiss equity options
trading planned to start this year.
    ""i'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are
conservative,"" one leading options analyst said, predicting
continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least
the next year.
    he said much of the recent growth in options had come from
inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. but
now the retail options market was beginning to take off.
    the market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted
floor of the london stock exchange. the floor has been left
almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in
the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have
encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.
    yesterday, the stock exchange decided to close the floor to
equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a
final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.
    the floor space could be used for a purpose-built options
market, but chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the
options market would need more than half of the available
space.

"<royal bank of canada>, in reporting a
19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    ""healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead,"" chairman allan taylor said in a statement.
    the bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended january 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    the bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    royal bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in trinidad and tobago.
    other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. the rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, royal bank said.
    the bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

    anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after

how much it will pay for datagraphix, but noted that
datagraphix contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to general

that anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
datagraphix. ""the estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs,"" harlow added.

"house ways and means committee
chairman dan rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
the tax increase if it did not have president reagan's support.
    he told a national press club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    however, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    there have been calls in congress to hold the rates at the
1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
    reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
increases.
    on trade issues, rostenkowski said he did not expect the
major trade bill this year would single out any u.s. industry
for special protection.
    ""to go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,""
he said.
    this apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
proposed again this year.

"the deal amr corp cut to buy 40 new
planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the
financial burden on aircraft manufacturers boeing co <ba> and
<airbus industrie>, a european consortium, analysts said.
    ""the terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the
manufacturers,"" said analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley and
co. ""they're called walkaway leases.""
    amr agreed to buy 15 planes from boeing and 25 from airbus
but said its american airlines unit will lease the aircraft,
which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.
    amr declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at
roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. american airlines will use the
planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its
service in the caribbean and to europe.
    but amr will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the
planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.
the carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year
extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days
notice by paying a small penalty, according to amr chairman
robert crandall.
    ""we're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,""
crandall told a press briefing here. he called the deals ""off
balance sheet"" limited obligation leases, under which the
financing is provided by the manufacturers.
    a spokesman for airbus confirmed those terms. ""we will own
the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us,"" he said.
airbus is providing american airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,
long-range a300-600 planes.
    a spokesman for boeing commercial airplane co, the unit of
boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part
of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.
    analysts said ""walkaway lease"" deals have been used before
by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of
planes, but not to this extent.
    julius maldutis of salomon brothers inc said the deal will
give amr financial stability as it grows. ""amr is using the
manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and
consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into
the early 1990s,"" he said.
    ""the deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will
increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners"" to
reduce their exposure to risk, he added.

"one of general electric co's biggest
businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
wall street analysts said.
    previously, it was expected the business would peak and
decline at some point in the next five years. the improved
outlook results from amr corp's <amr> decision to order 40 new
planes powered by cf6-80c2 ge engines.
    ""creative financial footwork helped ge get the order,"" said
nicholas heymann, analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc.
    amr declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
for its order of 15 boeing co <ba> and 25 <airbus industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    but amr said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. amr also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. the arrangement protects
amr in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    from ge's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, heymann said.
    ge will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, heymann noted.
    and if for some reason amr decides not to take the planes
ge's financial arm, general electric financial services inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. on the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for ge, heymann said.
    ge's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. h.p. smith, analyst at smith barney, harris upham
and co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock.""
    russell leavitt, analyst at salomon brothers inc, said the
order ""will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business"" for ge.
    heymann sees operating profits from ge's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    the rosy outlook for ge's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    heymann expects ge to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes ge has shown through its acquisition of rca corp
that it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    smith sees ge earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. he credits good results at rca, in turn aided by the
nbc broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.

bertone's steel-structured sports cars.
    alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in

     alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum
structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto
making methods and plants.
    alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a
car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and
performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. it
said the structures also provide long life without the need for
rust protection.
    the structure provides the same stiffness and safety as
present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65
pct reduction in spot welds, alcan said.

"the specialty retailing area continues
to pay off for f.w. woolworth co, once known only as a five and
dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
    it was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
the new york-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
ago.
    woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
per share. revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
    for the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
    roy garofalo, woolworth vice president, told reuters that
income generated by the company's specialty store operations
accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
    he said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
operating under 30 different names. woolworth plans to open 650
more specialty stores in 1987. at this time last year, it
operated 4,100 specialty stores, garofalo said.
    garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
woolworth is kinney shoe stores, followed by the richman
apparel unit. among other units are little folk shop, a chain
of discount children's apparel stores; the rx place, a discount
drug, health and beauty aid operation; and face fantasies,
which sells cosmetics. there are currently about 1,700
woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
which 1,200 are in the united states.
    harold sells, chairman and chief executive of woolworth,
said in a statement, ""these results are especially gratifying as
they are an improvement over last year's record earnings.""
    sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
period.
    woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
industry. in an attempt to compete in the 1970's, woolworth
opened a discount general store chain, woolco, and j. brannam,
a discount apparel chain. both were failures in the united
states, although woolco still operates in canada.
    in 1985, however, woolworth changed its strategy and
announced that it would operate specialty stores. at that time,
the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
than general merchandise stores.

"assistant treasury secretary david
mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily
indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease
their debt burden.
    ""in my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity
or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt
relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with
measures to encourage new equity investment and the
repatriation of flight capital,"" he told the house subcommittee
on international development institutions.
    mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to
the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging
from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions
for lending.
    ""while such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive,"" he said.
    he said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective
because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,
create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can
help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

"canadian economic growth is expected to
slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    ""the economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987,"" said carl beigie, chief economist at
dominion securities pitfield ltd.
    statistics canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    in the final quarter, gdp, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    ""essentially it is a flat performance,"" said warren jestin,
deputy chief economist at the bank of nova scotia.
    economist wendy smith cork of the brokerage nesbitt thomson
bongard inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number.""
    ""we weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she
added.
    the rise in gdp was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
federal finance minister michael wilson in his budget last
month. he also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    statistics canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    ""the sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the
federal agency said in a statement.
    the merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    but economist cork said the expected upturn in the u.s.
economy will lead to increased demand for canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. nearly 80 pct of
canada's exports are shipped to the u.s. each year.

"the bank of england proposed that banks
in britain for the first time will have to seek authorization
to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.
    in addition, the bank has proposed limits on the amount of
credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they
lead manage.
    the proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative
paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and
deposit takers and may be modified, the bank said.
    the rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond
securities issued each year. in 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of
new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by
euromoney magazine.
    up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead
managing eurobond issues.
    however, eurobond market participants believe the bank of
england is concerned about intense competition for market share
which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to
imprudent credit risk.
    competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as
banks compete to offer the best terms. but the new rules
suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as
regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk
than it can handle. banking sources said that while the bank of
england is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to
accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters
act prudently.
    ""the bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's
lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill
and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market
concerned...,"" the bank's proposal said.
    once a firm has received permission to act as lead
underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the
face amount of the securities. nominal exposure exceeding 60
pct of capital must be reported to the bank of england and it
must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of
capital.
    the exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of
28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. after
that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be
assessed at their full face value.
    the rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,
revolving credits or commercial paper, the bank said.
    the bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen
its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called
for comments from professionals by march 31 to allow their
possible inclusion in the banking bill in time for its planned
final discussion in parliament, scheduled before summer.
    the new banking bill, updating the 1979 banking act, is the
third leg of the conservative government's legislation for the
supervision of financial institutions.
    it is to feature alongside the financial services act,
aimed to bolster investor protection, and the building
societies act, which put these institutions on an equal footing
with banks.
    the proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between
recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal
controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.
    proposals to require banks to inform the bank of england in
advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their
capital, and to have the bank supervise exposures between 10
and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.
    however, preliminary consultations with bank
representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be
flawed, it said.
    most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a
case-by-case basis rather than along general lines.
    amendments involved the bank's proposed treatment of
exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other
units of their own group of companies, the paper showed.
    they also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to
local governments and other public sector entities, and of
exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.
    proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as
collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.
    exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their
own group of companies would usually be looked into on a
case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.
    the paper said exposures to state-owned industries and
other public sector authorities in the u.k. and abroad should
be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments
provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.
    it cautioned that exposures to u.k. local authorities and
those guaranteed by the british export credit guarantee
department would probably not qualify for such treatment.
    on credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of
another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling
could be exceeded in individual cases.
    but the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking
to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state
in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's
balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.
    on collateral security, it said this ""should normally only
be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a
bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base.""
    ""the presence of security taken on its own will be
considered by the bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure
in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional
circumstances and even then to a very limited extent,"" it said.

"the chairman of goodyear tire and rubber
co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that ""terrorists in three-piece suits"" are undermining
the nation's industrial base.
in a speech to a meeting of south florida business executives,
goodyear chairman robert mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  ""their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
america's industrial and providing jobs,"" he said. ""their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on.""
    last year, mercer fought off a takeover attempt by british
industrialist sir james goldsmith.
    but goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
mercer said.
    the company bought back goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.
    in an effort to trim its new debt, goodyear closed down
three plants mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
payroll by 10 pct, he said.
    mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a senate hearing
on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
takeovers have also hurt workers.

"soviet winter grains could be off to
a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall
and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.
    prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the
soviet union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to
forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.
    but the situation bears careful watching over the next six
weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and
future buying plans, analysts of the soviet union said.
    ""from a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that
the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a
lower crop (than last year),"" gail martell, chief meteorologist
for e.f. hutton said.
    the next six weeks in the ussr's grain growing areas will
be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of
the winter crops, martell and other analysts said.
    ""where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of
us,"" an agriculture department authority on the ussr said.
    the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares
of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.
this would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop
and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the
usda analyst said.
    with a timely spring, soviet farmers would probably be able
to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts
noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops
-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.
    normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover
combined with cold temperatures. this winter, however,
snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,
so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been
due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.
    ""fall dryness may be a problem. there's a good correlation
between mediocre crops and fall dryness,"" martell said.
    precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal
in southern and northern ukraine, and below normal over the
entire winter crop area, she said.
    recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the
snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused 
problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, jim candor, senior
forecaster for accu weather, said.
    livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the
fall and winter, analysts said. the dry fall damaged pastures,
the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would
require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.
    ""the soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they
don't have to buy (grains) now,"" a usda official said.
    but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and
if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a
one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more soviet
buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.
    bad weather during the next six weeks could push the
soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.
    ""a lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and
a half,"" martell said.

"crude oil prices rallied today, moving
over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of saudi arabia's determined
effort to support prices, analysts said.
    ""the saudis and other opec nations are jawboning the market,
hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without
another meeting,"" said sanford margoshes, oil analyst with
shearson lehman brothers inc.
    ""but opec is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to
seasonal declines in demand and some cheating,"" he added.
    oil industry analysts said saudi arabia has led the attempt
to get other opec members to resist pressures to discount from
the official prices agreed to last december.
    the analysts said that to get others to hold the line,
saudi arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers
of the gulf cooperation council last weekend and at the
cooperation council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.
    the saudis have also offered to support members having
difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.
    ""they are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to
prevent that, it appears that saudi arabia or some other opec
member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members
that lose sales,"" margoshes said.
    he added that the allocations would probably be in the form
of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.
    analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line
nations like qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. but it
is also likely that such assistance would be provided to
nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.
    analysts said that saudi arabia, with assistance from opec
president rilwanu lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency opec
meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the
december pact is falling apart.
    daniel mckinley, oil analyst with smith barney, upham
harris and co said, ""both physical and futures markets have been
oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short
covering rally.""
    he believes an iranian trade mission to tokyo, which
refused discounts to japanese buyers, brought japanese refiners
into the market to cover their short positions.
    oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market
to but 10 cargoes of may dubai, which sent prices up on mideast
sours, with dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading
yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the
north sea crude oil market.
    traders said that there have been persistent rumors today
that japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of brent
for japan and european trade sources indidate rumors of vessels
being fixed to make such shipments.
    north sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades
reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.
    opec members' denials that they are producing over their
quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.
    indonesian oil minister subroto said today that opec
production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last
december but he gave no details on opec production against
claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.
    ""the production probably is about their quota level and
largely because saudi arabia will not discount and canot sell
its oil as a result,"" margoshes said.
    analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the
current rally. some believe prices can continue to rise if
saudi arabia and opec hold steady in a refusal to discount.
    but others said that despite the rally today there were
still several fundamental factors, including demand, which
could cut the rally short.
    marion stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said
slow growth in the economies of the u.s. and oecd would keep
demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise
about 1.4 pct over 1986.

"coffee prices may have to fall even lower
to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ico delegates and
traders said.
    the failure last night of international coffee
organization, ico, producing and consuming countries to agree
export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
futures markets today with the london may price reaching a
4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
close.
    the new york may price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
    pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
ico talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
under prices, some senior traders said.
    the ico 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
march 2. this compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
february last year following a sharp rise in international
prices caused by drought damage to the brazilian crop.
    in a reuter interview, brazilian coffee institute, ibc,
president jorio dauster urged producers not to panic and said
they need to make hard commercial decisions. ""if we have failed
at the ico, at least we have tried,"" dauster said, adding ""now it
is time to go and sell coffee.""
    but brazil is keeping its marketing options open. it plans
to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
month, dauster said. it is too difficult to forecast now. trade
sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
previous crop of 11.2 mln. brazil is defining details of public
selling tenders for coffee bought on london's futures market
last year.
    a basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
market ""in one go"" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
    the breakdown of the ico negotiations reflected a split
between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
future quotas. consumers said ""objective criteria"" like average
exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
dauster said.
    all elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ""ad hoc"" way
of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ico.
    dauster said stocks and exports to ico members and
non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
that brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
    it is a ""simplistic misconception that brazil can dictate""
policy to other producers. while consumer countries are welcome
to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
difficult to allocate as different ""objective criteria"" achieve
different share-outs of quota, dauster said.
    other delegates said there was more open talking at the ico
and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
    consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
    ""we want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
supplies are needed at a later stage,"" one delegate said.
    some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ico
session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
and how much producers will sink their differences should
prices fall further and remain depressed.
    the ico executive board meets here march 30 to april 1 but
both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
negotiations will begin then. the board is due to meet in
indonesia in june with a full council scheduled for september.
    more cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
politics in debt heavy latin american producer countries could
bring ico members back around the negotiating table sooner than
many imagine. in that case quotas could come into force during
the summer. but most delegates and traders said quotas before
october are unlikely, while brazil's dauster noted the ico has
continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
    a clear difference between the pressures already being felt
by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
not be imposed now. at least in that way they said they could
show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
    in contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
    ""producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,"" one consumer said.

"the u.s. is sticking for the moment
to its policy that brazil, which two weeks ago suspended debt
payments to private banks, should deal with its creditors and
not with governments, u.s. officials said.
    ""i don't see any desire here to scurry around and help
brazil until we get a better sense of what they are trying to
do,"" a senior administration official stated.
    ""brazil has to do business through the banks at this point,""
said another official following an assessment of that country's
latest debt crisis.
    the official, who asked that his name not be used, said the
national security council, the treasury and state departments
and other agencies held a meeting yesterday to discuss the
situation.
    in a related development, small regional banks that have
made loans to brazil and other heavily-indebted latin american
countries, will meet with federal reserve chairman paul volcker
here tomorrow.
    brazil, with about 108 billion dlrs in debt, shocked banks
late last month when it stopped interest payments on 68 billion
dlrs owed to them until it can work out its problems.
    brazil's trade surplus, its main source of foreign exchange
has dwindled in recent months, making it difficult to service
its debt.
    the official said the interagency meeting was called to
discuss ""the general debt situation and compare notes on
(brazilian finance minister dilson) funaro.""
    funaro, who told reporters here that he wanted a political
discussion with industrialized nations on brazil's debt
problems in an effort to obtain more and faster lending from
official sources, held discussions here on friday with volcker,
treasury secretary james baker and other officials.
    another senior administration official said he was
perplexed by funaro's decision to discuss the latest crisis
with governments and not with creditor banks, at a time when
brazil is in danger of losing short-term credit lines.
    ""we are not clear at all on his tactics. to me it seems
bizarre, just bizarre,"" the official said.
    one official today described funaro's argument as ""nonsense,""
and said there had been a considerable flow of funds to brazil,
for which that country was in arrears.
    funaro has said brazil acted to protect its reserves but
wanted to avoid a confrontation.
    the consensus among administration officials seems to be
that brazil's latest debt crisis is the result of the domestic
economic problems.
    ""brazil is a special case, but there's no doubt they would
not be in the mess they're in if they had not screwed-up their
economic policy,"" a senior official added.
    several of the regional banks that will meet with volcker
tomorrow declined to comment because the talks will be held at
the fed's suggestion.
    ""since they are the hosts, we feel it's up to them if they
want to say something,"" one regional bank official said.
    but other banking sources said that regional banks, many of
which are refusing to continue lending to latin america, are
dissatisfied with decisions of major banks such as citibank, in
the refinancing of foreign debts.
    the sources added that volcker, for his part, is
dissatisfied with some major banks' refusal to make interest
rate concessions to brazil and other latin american debtors,
and would like to see smaller creditor banks take a more actve
role in the rescheduling process.

"total supply of frozen concentrated
orange juice (fcoj) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly
above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below
the previous season, the u.s. agriculture department said.
    in a summary of its fruit situation report, the department
said florida's imports of fcoj, mostly from brazil, have shown
sharp gains to date.
    the department noted the price of fcoj will probably be
affected by the final decision, scheduled for april 22, on
whether the u.s. considers brazilian fcoj exports to the u.s.
have caused injury.
    continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit
coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower
prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.
    the department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage
at the beginning of february were moderately larger than a year
earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.
    in view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced
supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.
    during the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed
noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
    movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining
suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a
consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.

chairman dan rostenkowski would want white house support for
any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions,
before considering the issue, a staff member said.
    in addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on
whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said.
    rostenkowski, an illinois democrat whose committee is in
charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with house
speaker jim wright, a texas democrat, to discuss a variety of
tax and budget issues, an aide said. he added that wright did
not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday
as a possible way to cut the federal deficit.
    the aide to wright added that wright asked the ways and
means committee to look into the securities transfer tax.
however, he said wright had not recommended it as he had
another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level
rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.
    wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases
of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17
billion dlrs a year, the aide said.
    the new york stock exchange said it had not seen the
proposal by the house speaker but added that it is ""strongly
opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities
transactions.""

""such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide

industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time

corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
and 50 pct in cash, the u.s. agriculture department said.
    it said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the gramm-rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, usda said.
    the department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
september-january.
    national weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    the deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in october if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.

said the company has made several proposals to texaco inc <tx> 
to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to pennzoil and
that a settlement was ""in the best interests of both
companies.""
    liedtke, in a letter mailed today to pennzoil shareholders,
said texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent
public statements that pennzoil was not interested in settling
the case.
    ""pennzoil has made texaco several proposals, both before
and after trial, to settle this dispute,"" liedtke said in the
letter. ""we do not know why texaco's officials would now make
such clearly untrue statements.""
    last month, a texas state appeals court upheld a jury
judgment that texaco illegally interfered with pennzoil's plan
to acquire getty oil in 1983. the appeals court reduced by two
billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded
to pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the
total amount back above 10 billion dlrs.
    pennzoil said that texaco had made four unsatisfactory
proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.
    ""other than to put on the record that it has made offers,
texaco's proposals make no sense,"" liedtke said in the letter.
""in fact, two of texaco's offers were identical and were
proposals that texaco knew in advance pennzoil would not
accept.""
    the letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made
by either pennzoil or texaco.
    ""if and when texaco's management changes its position and
demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to
settle this matter, pennzoil will make every effort to
cooperate,"" liedtke said. ""such a solution, i believe, is
clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not
attractive, as a personal matter, to texaco's management and
directors.""
    liedtke said that cash flow from the getty oil assets and
profits from those assets that have since been sold
""approximately equaled"" texaco's purchase price of 10 billion
dlrs for getty.

    however, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the
foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to
a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints
of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private
foundations by the tax reform act of 1969, according to the
hilton corp.

than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. anything over
that figure had to be sold.
    the lawyers explained that when conrad hilton died, the law
required that excess holdings by the foundation above 20 pct of

"the australian government will likely
reimburse the australian wheat board, awb, about 132 mln (u.s.)
dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the u.s.
agriculture department said.
    in its report on export markets for u.s. grains, the
department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
reduced the export sales revenue of the awb to levels
insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
around 98 dlrs per tonne.
     for example the recent large sales of wheat to china (1.5
mln tonnes) and egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
breakeven export price, it said.
    australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
payment known as the guaranteed minimum price, gmp, calculated
at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
department said.
    in addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
storage are deducted from the gmp the farmer receives.
    but the department said the australian bureau of
agricultural economics, bae, predicts wheat production will
drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
1989/90.
    the decline will result from low world grain prices leading
to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit u.s.
wheat exports, the department said.

countries to stay within their production quotas, said morgan

to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    ""over the next few weeks i think you'll see a concerted
effort by the saudis to get production down,"" wellemeyer said.
    ""the saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again,"" he said.
    in recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some ope members producing
above their quota, pushing total opec production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. but prices rebounded today, with april u.s.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief saudi arabia is attempting to curb opec output.
    wellemeyer said that sharp declines in u.s. oil production
could push demand for opec oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    although the projected increases in demand for opec oil
should strengthen world prices, wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. the interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the

"chicago board of trade grain traders and
analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
in the futures markets.
    professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. that gives
deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
    farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
    with the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
attractive under normal circumstances.
    an announcement late friday that the usda will lift the
limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
traders said.
    here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
more attractive deal from the government, they added.
    cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the south to
put soybean land back into cotton.
    one of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
traditional cotton producing regions of the south to soybeans,
which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent
repurchase of shares from texan h. ross perot last year.
    ""he (perot) was obviously the big trigger"" said analyst
joseph phillippi of e.f. hutton co. ""there was a firestorm of
criticism from people on the institutional side.""
    wall street analysts said the gm buyback will boost the
shares in the near term but some had reservations about the
long term effects of the plan.
    ""they're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by
the buyout of ross perot,"" said analyst david healy of drexel
burnham lambert inc.
    healy said general motors chairman roger smith had been
hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional
investors. he said the plan, which could cost more than five
billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to ford motor
co's <f> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis
than that of chrysler corp <c>.
    healy said general motors will have to borrow money to buy
back stock on a large scale.
    the general motors plan, announced after a board of
directors meeting in new york, calls for repurchase of up to 20
pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.

announcement. however subsequently jefferies and co, which

ronald glantz, analyst at montgomery securities.
    ""i don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming
from unless they borrow,"" glantz said. ""their credit rating is
going to fall."" gm said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending.
    glantz believes gm could be inviting a strike this fall by
going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has
37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for
closing. after deciding against a profit sharing bonus for
workers and buying out perot for 743 mln dlrs ""this will be
seen as rubbing salt into the wound,"" glantz said. ""gm must be
challenging the union to make it the strike target.""

and expects the shares to rise. but he said he did not think
the overall plan was ""prudent.""
    ""obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in
the stock tomorrow,"" hutton's phillippi said.

reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels
""they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the
confines of their cash flow."" phillippi, who has been telling
clients to hold gm shares mainly for income, said on balance

his central america policy from the iran arms scandal, said a
major u.s. economic program for the region was working but
needed 500 mln dlrs more than originally planned.
    in a report to congress, he called for immediate approval
of 300 mln dlrs in new 1987 economic aid for four central
american democracies and eventual full-funding of a total
economic program costing 8.9 billion dlrs through 1992.
    the report, mandated by congress, explains how the
administration intends to carry out the recommendations of the
reagan-appointed kissinger commission, which in 1984 developed
a blueprint for u.s. policy in the region that was meant to
offset reagan's military aid program for nicaraguan rebels.
    the commission, headed by former secretary of state henry
kissinger, had proposed a 8.4 billion dlr program through 1989.
    ""the soviet union and its allies have provided the
sandinista regime military hardware and sufficient economic aid
to keep nicaragua's failed economy afloat,"" reagan said.
    assistant secretary of state elliott abrams, who briefed
reporters, said the administration will not try to link
approval of military aid for the rebels, known as contras, with
the vastly more popular economic package for the region, as
some republican leaders in congress have suggested.

scandal, congress would approve this year's final 40 mln dlr
allotment in military aid for the rebels, who are fighting
managua's leftist sandinista government.
    abrams admitted the administration would have its toughest
fight in the democratic-controlled house, but said he believed

    privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of
all new issues eventually become part of either an interest
rate or currency swap.
    an interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually
acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's
interest payments on debt securities. usually, the issuer of a
floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice
versa. but the obligation for repayment of the debt remains
with the original borrower.
    bank regulators have become concerned about the use of
swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some
portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the
balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient
capital to cushion it.
    kenneth mccormick, a co-chairman of the isda and president
of kleinwort benson cross financing inc, said the bank of
england and the u.s. federal reserve board were expected later
today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital
standards for counterparties in swaps.
    the standards are part of the recently announced
convergence agreement between the two countries in which
regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements
for institutions.
    mccormick told reporters the isda was concerned that a
""level playing field"" be maintained in the swaps market.
    he said if u.k. and u.s. banks were required to hold more
primary capital against swap transactions than is the current
practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to
issuers.
    the issuers might then choose to do business with
lower-cost banks which are not subject to u.s. or u.k. banking
rules.

exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
depend on the amount of dividends received from westcoast

sales of westar timber's skeena and celgar pulp mills and

"venezuela plans to have a public sector
foreign debt of 26.5 billion dlrs by early 1989 when the
present government of president jaime lusinchi ends its term,
public finances director jorge marcano said.
    he said the target, which compares with around 24.5 billion
dlrs now and 29 billion at end 1983, is considered a manageable
amount which will assist in development plans.
    the government last week reached agreement with its 13-bank
advisory committee to reprogramme its 12-1/2 year rescheduling
accord over 14 years with the interest margin lowered to 7/8
pct over london interbank offered rate (libor) from 1-1/8 pct.
    in an interview with el universal newspaper, marcano said
he thought u.s. government pressure on banks had more to do
with the unexpectedly speedy agreement than brazil's decision
to suspend interest payments.
    ""i think what speeded an agreement was the attitude of the
u.s. government, which urged several major banks to soften
their position in various debt renegotiations. the brazil
announcement came later,"" he said.
    bankers noted citibank had held up an agreement with chile,
objecting to proposals for delayed interest payments. a pact
with chile, with a one pct spread, came a day before
venezuela's.
    marcano said a telex sent to venezuela's 450 creditors
seeks support for the government's foreign borrowing plans,
which are aimed at aluminium, steel and iron ore projects. ""we
cannot rule out a trip to financial centres to explain the new
agreement and present the financing programmes we have,"" he
said, adding he hoped to restore credit ratings of the 1970s.
    lusinchi said on monday the government will limit foreign
borrowing, which would come from banks and multilateral
agencies, to 50 pct of interest and principal paid in the next
two years. according to the restructured accord, this would
work out at around 2.5 billion dlrs.

mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution
system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln
dlrs.
    the utility said it advised a customer task force this is
one restructuring alternative being considered for the
company's electric business.
    the structure is being evaluated as part of the company's
overall initiative in response to several goals announced by
new mexico governor garrey carruthers, it explained.
    public service new mexico said a central feature of its
reorganization concept would be to separate the company's
electric utility operation into independent generation and
distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted
35 mln dlr a year rate decrease.
    noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a
variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes
""the concept may well have an application in the utility
business and intend to investigate it fully.""
    the generation company would provide projected power needs
of the distribution entity under a 30-year ""power security
agreement"" which would have a federally regulated rate
structure, the company said.
    public service new mexico said the restructuring could
provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility
companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company
approved by the company's shareholders in may 1986.
    this holding company would be the general partner of the
limited partnership, the company said.
    the company said its limited partnership concept was
presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by gov.
carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals.
    it said the reorganization and limited partnership are an
alternative structure that would  help reduce rates through a
lower overall cost of capital.
    last month the governor said ""i have outlined to pnm
critical goals which i have asked them to cooperate with may
administration in achieving"" adding the goals include immediate
rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation
of business expansion.
    the company told the task force the new distribution
company, under the limited partnership alternative or
otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state
regulators.
    pnm's proposed generation company would continue to be
owned by common shareholders through the holding company. its
rates would be set by the federal energy regulatory commission
which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and
transmission services. the generation company would have no
retail customers.

"a one billion stg issue of nine pct
exchequer stock due 2002 which became available for trading
only this morning was exhausted in mid-afternoon trading on the
u.k. government bond market, dealers said.
    the bank of england said the issue was no longer operating
as a tap. the issue was announced monday at a price of 96 stg
pct and dealers said the government broker's supplies were sold
out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. the bonds
started trading this morning at 20 stg pct.
    dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand
throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.
    dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from
both domestic and overseas sources, including from japan and
the u.s.
    although the issue had not been designated as free of tax
to residents abroad (fotra) widespread bullish sentiment for
the market in general had generated foreign buying.
    the stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it
was announced and dealers said that even first thing this
morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable
existing stocks.
    however, sterling's continuing firm performance had
prompted interest in the tap right at the outset.
    the issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid
structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of
the major part of the price until april 27, but also conferred
a substantial gearing element.
    this meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought
the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the
market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total
purchase price was tied up initially.

"the geneva motor show, the first major
car show of the year, opens tomorrow with u.s. car makers
hoping to make new inroads into european markets due to the
cheap dollar, automobile executives said.
    ford motor co <f> and general motors corp <gm> sell cars in
europe, where about 10.5 mln new cars a year are bought. gm
also makes a few thousand in north american plants for european
export.
     now chrysler corp <c> is saying it will begin exporting
american-made vehicles before the end of this year to europe, a
market it left in 1978 when it was near bankruptcy.
    ford's european operations in britain and west germany
manufactured and sold about 1.5 million cars in europe last
year -- the largest u.s. manufacturer's share of the european
market.
    opel/vauxhall, with factories in west germany, spain and
britain, accounted for most of gm's sales in europe with about
1.3 million vehicles in 1986, officials said.
    james fry of gm overseas distribution system said gm hoped
for a five-fold rise this year in sales of north american-made
vehicles in europe, selling between 7,000 and 8,000 (north
american-made) units in europe for the year to august 1987. ""a
low dollar makes our prices very attractive,"" he told reuters.
    using an average price of 13,000 dlrs per car, his
projected sales figure would translate into between 91 million
and 104 mln dlrs in turnover, fry added.
    that would be a jump from 1986 when gm sold 1,500
north-american made cars for revenue of 19 mln dlrs.
    ford has 41 factories in west europe, which manufacture all
of its cars sold on the continent.  but walter hayes, vice
president of ford europe, told reuters he did not expect a
large rise in sales this year as a result of the weak dollar. 
""we have concluded that despite the dollar difference.... europe
is inevitably a small volume market.""
    hayes said the cost of changing american cars to conform to
european environmental specifications cut into profit margins.
    but robert lutz, chrysler executive vice-president, said
the weak dollar would now help chrysler compete in europe. 
""after a lapse of almost nine years, chrysler is about to
re-enter the european market,"" he said.
    ""we prefer to export to europe rather than manufacture here
because it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of
the favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the

"the federal reserve board voted
unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
to come up with a new capital standard for u.s. banks that
takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
assets.
    fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
today by the bank of england.
    the fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
    the proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
contracts and similar financial instruments.
    previously, the fed jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
that banks would be required to take into account in
calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
maintain.
    both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
    the additional guidelines proposed today would determine
the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
    the current exposure would be measured by the
mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
replacement cost.
    potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
analyses by the staffs of the bank of england and u.s. banking
regulators. future exposure would rise over the life of the
asset.
    the fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
    they ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
    board officials said the new gauge could increase the
capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
the principal participants in these types of activities.
    they cautioned the fed board to take account of the
potential impact of the plan on the ability of u.s. banks to
compete in world financial markets.
    however, the staff concluded, ""the credit risks inherent in
such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
profiles of some banking organizations.""
    the fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
    also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
contracts traded on organized exchanges.
    governor martha seger said she was concerned that japan was
not involved in the u.k.-u.s. effort to draft new capital
rules.

"the 350 mln ecu three-year package of
social and structural measures agreed early today by european
community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers
for reducing output of certain surplus products, ec commission
sources said.
    the ministers agreed that under this ""extensification""
scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut
output of specific products by at least 20 pct.
    the plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and
wine, they added.
    cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by
reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their
number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. in each case,
farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity
for output of other products which are in surplus in the ec.
    the sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but
will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on
the production they forego.
    the sources said the package also contains provisions for
payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting
or improving the environment.
    it would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured
farming areas would be extended to crops. at present such
allowances are available only for livestock.
    the package would provide 20 mln ecus for research into
alternative farming techniques, the sources added.
    at a news conference ec farm commissioner frans andriessen
said the commission is also working on proposals to enable the
ec and member states to provide direct income supports for
relatively poor farmers.
    andriessen did not give full details, but said member state
aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of
competition.""
    ec payments would aim to help farmers to survive a
difficult period while the ec tackles the problems of surplus
production.
    the commission withdrew from the package agreed last night
proposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55
or over who gave up production. those who took their land
completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to
their heirs, would have received more generous payments.
    andriessen said the commission plans to present revised
proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme

"the bank of england and the u.s. federal
reserve board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to
measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not
show up in bank balance sheets, the bank of england said.
    the plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options
involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals
agreed in january between the two central banks to make
commercial banks in the u.s. and britain subject to similar
standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.
    it said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks
have until april 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.
    the bank of england and fed said they had faced a dilemma.
    ""on the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate
capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other
hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital
requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of u.s. and
u.k. banking organisations to price...contracts competitively.""
     at the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the
so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a
currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its
potential change in value due to currency or interest rate
fluctuations until the contract matures.
    in treatment similar to that agreed in january for balance
sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of
five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the
quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the
contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the
plans showed.
    the proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would
not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.
    they would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk
weights. the only guarantees recognised are those given by u.s.
and u.k. governments or, in the u.s., by domestic national
government agencies, the proposals showed.
    the paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot

"failure of talks on re-establishing
international coffee organization, ico, coffee quotas last week
may put political pressure on the united states, particularly
the state department, to reassess its position, but the u.s. is
unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by
""objective criteria"", u.s. officials said.
    jon rosenbaum, assistant u.s. trade representative and head
of washington's delegation to the talks, told reuters on his
return from london that the united states is willing to resume
the coffee negotiations as early as april if necessary.
    rosenbaum said the united states will be ""flexible"" in
discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and
any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of
establishing an objective method of setting quotas.
    at the ico talks major consuming nations, led by the u.s.,
proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated
by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable
production and verified stocks, while large producers led by
brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of
shares. the consumer position would have in effect reduced the
market share of brazil, by far the world's largest producer.
    rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support
legislation now before congress which would allow the u.s.
customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply
with any future coffee quotas.
    he said the reagan administration would be reviewing the
coffee policy situation following the collapse of the london
talks, but ""nobody is proposing we change our position.""
    however, other u.s. government officials involved in coffee
policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market
offensive from producer countries, led by brazil and colombia,
to soften the consumer position.
    ""knowing that its next crop is fairly large, brazil will
kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and
consumers,"" said one u.s. official.
    the u.s. official, who asked not to be identified, said
brazil and colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few
months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other
countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers
who differed with the major producers in london.
    this in turn could lead to urgent appeals from latin
american countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the
u.s. state department, and to the national security council in
the white house, for an easing of the u.s. position, u.s.
officials said.
    the state department, a major player in setting u.s. coffee
policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from
politically-sensitive u.s. allies in central america, u.s.
officials said.
    el salvador and guatemala both backed brazil and colombia
at the london talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on
objective criteria. but the dominican republic and costa rica
joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to
objective criteria.
    there is a strong feeling among some in the state
department that the united states should continue to support
the splinter group of producers who have taken the
politically-risky step of opposing brazil on the objective
criteria question, u.s. officials said.
    within the consuming countries there also is expected to be
some pressure to reassess positions.
    in london, the u.s. was supported by the u.k., the
netherlands, west germany, japan, australia and new zealand on
the issue of objective criteria, u.s. officials said.
    this bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations
to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.
    however, u.s. sources said west germany's support was at
times qualified and there is some concern that the european
community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to
producers in future talks. france backed the ivory coast and
other african producers during the talks.
    a softening of the ec stance would make it more difficult,
although not impossible, for the u.s. to block producer plans.
    while political manuevering by small producers and
consuming countries will be important, u.s. officials said the
key to any future outcome will be brazil's position.
    u.s. officials blamed brazil's intransigence for the
failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from
brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

"torrential rains throughout
argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse
grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
    sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
affected, they said. but the rains proved to be a great aid to
soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until april or
may.
    the rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum
crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.
    rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in buenos aires,
with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors,
between 15 and 100 mm in cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in la pampa, 10
and 75 mm in santa fe, 10 and 60 mm in entre rios, five and 40
mm in misiones, and five and 50 mm in san luis.
    no rain was recorded in corrientes, chaco and formosa.
    growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.
    maize harvesting continued moving forward in central santa
fe, though slowly. growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.
    total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was
estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to
seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the
1985/86 harvest.
    maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11
mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6
mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,
or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to
official figures.
    the sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
pct of total planted area.
    two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure
of 3.14 mln hectares.
    sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln
and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and
41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the
1985/86 harvest.
    grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to
1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln
hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
    sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and
3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2
million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.
    soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a
record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of
11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3
mln tonnes, according to private estimates. official figures
put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.
    soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.

"drilling for oil in california is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    because much of the crude oil in california fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    ""companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""
said john curti, an analyst with birr wilson securities inc.
    few new wells now are being drilled.
    only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in california last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said bill bolster of munger oil
information services, which tracks california drilling
activity.
    ""it's in the dregs right now,"" said bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said ed malmgreen of the california independent
producers association.
    while an organization of petroleum exporting countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    prices for california's marker grade, line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    more than half of california's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, malmgreen said.
    ""it's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""
malmgreen said.
    many stripper wells along the southern california coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    the outlook for future production in california is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    in the heart of california's oil patch, kern county, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in kern county in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to david mitchell of
the state energy commission. so far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    ""i don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year,"" mitchell said.
    no pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, mitchell said.
    along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    between february and october of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in california fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said bill guerard of the california energy
commission.
    in line with that decrease, california's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    between february and october 1986, california's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, guerard said.
    total estimated crude oil production in california for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the california department of
conservation.
    ""production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""
guerard said.

"wall street traders said the stock of
outboard marine corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
television program that outboard is a likely takeover target of
sun chemical corp <snl>.
    outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. on tuesday it rose 1-3/8
to 31-1/2 tuesday.
    a report on cable news network today said sun chemical has
4.9 pct of outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
for control of the whole company.
    an outboard marine spokesman would not comment on the
rumor.
    the cable program said a buyout of outboard would be for up
to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
    a spokesman for sun chemical was not immediately available.
    outboard marine last june adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
    wayne jones, vice president at outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. ""we are
not trying to sell the company. we are proceeding with our
strategic plans,"" he said.
    that plan includes integrating five boat companies that
outboard marine has bought since the middle of december. jones
said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
    an analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
""decent"" price for outboard. ""a bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. maybe 45 dlrs a share tops,"" he said.
    outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with morgan
stanley inc. it makes sense, the analyst said, for sun chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

    ""they're all lower,"" he said. ""this is really getting
pretty serious. we're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.""
    farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    if the wheat board, which markets most of canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. if
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    the final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
april, rests with wheat board minister charles mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    last year mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
    but federal agricultural officials have already warned
farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

"the ruling gatt council deferred a
decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
european community complaint against the u.s.- japanese
agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
    david woods, spokesman of the general agreement on tariffs
and trade (gatt), told a news briefing that the main parties
would continue bilateral talks. this was in the hope of
resolving the row before the next council meeting on april 15.
    the five-year accord signed in july 1986 aims to protect
the u.s. market from dumping of low-price japanese microchips,
officially known as semiconductors.
    the e.c. complained the accord breached gatt trade rules by
allowing tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
prices for japanese chips sold in third countries.

u.s. producers preferential access to the japanese market.

"general motors corp staged an explosive
rally on wall street after a share buyback program announced
yesterday, but analysts said gm's future remains clouded by
stiff competition and erosion of market share.
    gm shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. analysts
agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
    ""i'm very positive on gm,"" said jack kirnan of kidder
peabody and co. ""they're clearly committed to enhancing
shareholder value.""
    however, some analysts worry about how gm will pay for the
buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
recapture lost market share.
    after the market had closed yesterday, gm said it would buy
back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. the
announcement sent investors today scrambling for gm shares,
with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
    the buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
least one increased his earnings estimates for gm based on a
good performance expected from new car models.
    but david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said the
repurchase program is not a positive.
    ""the buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
puts more stress on the balance sheet,"" he said, since gm will
have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. the stock
should settle back down to around 76, he added.
    healy projects gm will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
healy's numbers are near the low end of wall street estimates,
which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
    like other analysts, healy sees gm's share of the domestic
car and truck market falling in 1987. ""on balance, gm cars are
not selling as well as their competitors,"" he said.
    in late february, gm car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
year-ago period while competitors ford motor co <f> and
chrysler corp <c> both posted increases. but gm said february
sales showed improvement over january, adding that it expects
improvement in coming months.
    overall, gm's share of u.s. car and truck sales should fall
to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
analysts said. the numbers include imports.
    kidder peabody's kirnan said cost reductions and product
improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
fourth quarter, which will help gm finance the buyback.
    ""gm (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
its sleeves and getting serious. i think there's a major
earnings surprise in the winds,"" he said.
    kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees gm earning
5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. ""the company is more
concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
with respect to ford and chrysler,"" he said.
    another positive for the stock is gm's dividend, currently
five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
its competitors, kirnan said. and gm will raise the cash
dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
    but analyst michael lucky of shearson lehman brothers inc
said u.s. car sales will weaken, and gm's new products, if
successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
market share.
    ""i believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
only curtail losses in market share,"" which will fall to around
35 pct by 1990, lucky said.
    philip fricke of goldman sachs and co falls in the middle
of the bulls and bears. while he is recommending gm stock, he
said results will not improve until 1988.
    ""i'm not looking for improvement this year. this is a
transition year for gm,"" he said.
    fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
affect 1987 results. ""but the key thing isn't so much what they
earn this year. it's the momentum beyond this year that's
important.""

"healthy growth in corporate profits and in
consumer spending, the two pillars on which japan rests its
hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the
core, economists polled by reuters said.
    profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace
exports as the engine of growth. but close ties between
corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative
economic model promises little but slower growth, they said.
    falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn
will cut sales and further reduce profits.
    the bank of japan said in its latest outlook that improved
terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic
demand grow steadily.
    however, this would happen only if household spending
increased in line with the value of real financial assets due
to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as
profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from
exports.
    ""no clear sign of such developments has so far been
evidenced,"" the central bank said.
    poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth
will be slow, even though japan's terms of trade have improved
sharply due to the strong yen. economist david pike of phillips
and drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct
while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price
margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies
did not pass that advantage on to the consumer.
    last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the
fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in
consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of
trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.
    the economists, however, believe this layer of fat will
protect companies for only a short while. as more firms seek
more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic
competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.
retail prices will fall. profit margins will suffer.
    a december survey by top business organisation keidanren
confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.
    of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost
80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production
volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,
said keidanren economist kazuyuki kinbara.
    main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting
unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors
(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down
wages, and reducing bonuses. the government has said it fears
unemployment could soon double from three pct now.
    unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt
sales. but reduced bonuses, and worries about individual
financial security could be even more damaging.
    twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what
amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to
buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.
    to save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied
bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.
    economists also predict japanese will not save less than
the average 16 pct of salary they do now. on the contrary, a
poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the
resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,
and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.
    the last government survey of public opinion said over 80
pct of citizens will continue to economise. japan has a rapidly
ageing population and minimal social security and its workers
fear poverty in their old age.
    faced with such a vicious circle, the government's
reflationary strategies are severely limited.
    the commitment by the ruling liberal democratic party and
finance ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small
supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive
without reducing revenue. independent economists have been less
than excited at the results.
    provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.
    the 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically
impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate
at only 0.25 pct, bank of tokyo economist haruo muto said.
    almost 60 pct of japanese still hold their savings in some
kind of deposit, official figures show.
    moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while
firms are planning cuts in capital investment.
    the central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land
prices are the only current results of high liquidity.
    fear of inflation also limits policy options. political
analysts ascribe prime minister yasuhiro nakasone's 1986 big
election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price
inflation. and he found this year that attempts to impose a
sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.

"texas railroad commissioner james
nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
congress to act, today urged texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    nugent said in a speech to the texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding u.s. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    his proposal to revitalize texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. he said that the
majority of texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, nugent
said. his plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    ""we've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. i say we have waited long enough,"" nugent
said. ""in other words, let's tell washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way.""
    nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

"pacific telesis group chairman donald
guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
    guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
remain flat each year through 1989. he noted that all captial
spending will be internally financed.
    guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its pacific
bell operating company.
    in rates hearings before, the california public utility
commission, guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
    the company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
rate hike requested for 1986. guinn said the commission found
180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
modernization costs.
    guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
transpacific telephone cable between the u.s. and japan.
    ""we have not agreed to anything,"" guinn said, but added he
would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
company would make a decision soon on participating.
    asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
u.s. department of justice which would allow the bell operating
companies to offer limited long distance services, guinn said
the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
    ""(long distance services) is a very competitive business.
it's a commodity business and becoming more so,"" he said. ""i'm
not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
business.""
    however, guinn generally applauded the u.s.
recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
alliances with other companies.
    he added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
talks. ""we do not have anything actively under consideration,""
he said.

"u.s. and u.k. bank regulators are asking
banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion
them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency
swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.
    after viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by
the bank of england and the federal reserve board, dealers said
that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside
reserves twice for the same risk.
    market participants will have 60 days to respond to the
proposals.
    adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially
significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume
of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled
by euromoney magazine. while no firm figures exist, dealers in
eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved
in some swap arrangement. separately, the isda estimates that
about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are
outstanding. kenneth mccormick, co-chairman of the
international swap dealers association (isda) and president of
kleinwort benson cross financing inc, said that the association
has no comment and will study the proposals.
    ""what they are proposing is really double counting,"" patrick
de saint-aignan, managing director of swaps for morgan stanley
and co, said. instead, he argues, banks should either be
required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct
per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of
replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.
    ""the potential risk factors are very large relative to what
we had expected,"" said a director at one u.k. merchant bank.
""what they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now --
to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might
have 10 years from now,"" he added.(adds title first paragraph).
    dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by
the agreement, such as those based in japan, will have a
competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the
costs on to customers.
    indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the
exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. federal
reserve board governor martha seger, following approval of the
proposed guidelines by the fed, said she is concerned that
japan was not involved in the u.k.-u.s. effort to draft new
capital rules.
     dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank
regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is,
offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single
counterparty against each other.
    the paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that
such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce
credit risk."" furthermore, the paper said, if a netting
agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it
might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.
    but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an
airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.
     ""one problem is that there has never been a major default
in the swaps market. so we don't know if any of the swap
arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank
official.

"the canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the bank of canada to make ""aggressive
use"" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    the report, authored by retired governor gerald bouey, also
noted advances to canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
january, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on canada savings bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    ""the aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs,"" said bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor john crow last month.
    the amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    the reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, bouey said.
    bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of december from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in march, 1986.
    the advances were made largely to four banks, canadian
commercial bank, northland bank, continental bank of canada and
the bank of british columbia. the first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the

he erred, white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told

recommendations. he'll focus on changes he's making in the

"key tax and budget lawmakers
wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new
securities tax, which has has aroused concern on wall street
and put pressure on brokerage stocks.
    grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut
federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target
of 108 billion dlrs, house speaker jim wright suggested the tax
be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues.
    the texas democrat's idea as first presented to house ways
and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski this week would
tax sales and purchases of securities. a tax of 0.25 to 0.5
percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.
    rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early
to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities
transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by
congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.
    the illinois democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he
is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as president reagan
maintains his staunch opposition.
    ""first we've got to decide whether to raise additional
revenues. only then can we consider the specific options. at
this point nothing is on or off the table. it's just too early,""
rostenkowski said in a statement.
    he made no commitment to wright in a private meeting
tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a house source
said. the idea was presented only as something that might or
might not be valuable, he said.
    house budget committee chairman william gray agreed it was
another option to be looked at, if congress decided it needed
to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said.
   the pennsylvania democrat does not intend to recommend
specific tax proposals, the aide said. the budget committee
will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in
1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision
on how the taxes will be raised.
    the securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of
revenue to ease congress's difficult task of trimming the
deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.
    but some in congress feared that such a tax could drive
securities business offshore and hurt u.s. investment, and
there were uncertainties about the details of the tax.
    democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so
far this year. this week they are scheduled to discuss the
budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no
decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said.
    at the same time, without president reagan's assent to a
general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that
are guaranteed to anger those who must pay.
    ""we could just do all of them,"" one congressional source said
of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil
import fee and others.

viacom's independent directors on behalf of viacom entered into

picture admissions in the u.s. has shown no growth in 15 years.

"a senior british official said that
protectionist bills being considered by congress could trigger
retaliation by the european community (eec) and threaten the
global trading system.
    paul channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if
congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which
would hit ec shipments as well as shipments from major asian
textile producers, ""the community would have to retaliate.""
    his comments echoed those made yesterday by belgian trade
minister herman de croo, who said if the bill passed, the
community would retaliate by imposing taxes on u.s. exports.
    channon made his remarks at a news conference after two
days of talks with reagan administration officials and members
of congress.
    de croo was also in washington for trade talks.
    channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in
congress since his visit here last year as congress and the
administration tried to find ways to reduce the u.s. trade
deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.
    channon also called for greater ec-u.s. cooperation to
force japan to open its markets to foreign goods.
    channon said japan's trade surplus is causing everyone
problems - its surplus with the united states last year was
51.5 billion dlrs and with ec nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.
    ""the more united pressure there could be, the better,"" he
said.
    channon also called for increased u.s.-ec cooperation to
avoid trade disputes.
    he said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation
earlier this year over lost grains sales when spain and
portugal joined the community and its liberal imports
regulations were tightened to conform to ec standards.
    ""but if both sides drew back from the brink that time,"" he
said, """"it does not mean that they would do so on another
occasion.""
    channon added that ""there is increasing reesentment in
europe over the u.s. tactic of negotiating under the pressure
of unilaterally imposed deadlines.""
    he said other potential conflicts are already in sight -
alleged european government subsidies of airbus aircraft and
taxes on fats and oils - and ""the commuity and the united states
must therefore learn to manage their relations better.""
    he said another bill to let the united states retaliate
against a nation if that nation's market was not open to u.s.
goods would bypass the trade pact gatt (general agreeeement on
tariffs and trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.

"the united auto workers and american
motors corp agreed to resume talks on a new labor contract for
the company's threatened kenosha, wisc. assembly plant despite
a breakdown in talks last weekend, uaw vice-president marc
stepp said.
    stepp told reporters that issues which caused the talks to
break off are being discussed between the two sides and that a
main table bargaining session has been scheduled friday in
milwaukee.
    france's regie nationale des usines renault has a
controlling stake in american motors.
    stepp said the union intends ""to exert full efforts"" to
reach an agreement that would keep the plant in operation past
1989, when amc has said production will end unless the uaw
grants concessions on labor costs.
    the uaw leader said the company and the union agreed in
principle in 1985 to pattern a future contract covering some
6,000 kenosha workers after lower-cost uaw contracts covering
mazda motor corp's new u.s. plant in michigan and the new
united motor plant in california operated by toyota.
    stepp said there is such deep hostility between the company
and union locals in milwaukee and kenosha that communication
between them is very difficult.
    but he said it is possible to reach agreement on a new
contract to save the jobs of uaw members at amc's wisconsin
operations despite the impasse.
    amc has said it will resume talks, but only for 24 hours to
ascertain whether the union was willing to agree to the
concessions it wants.

debt of more than 6.1 billion canadian dlrs will likely be
detailed to a group of 56 major creditors on monday or tuesday
next week, a company spokesman said.
    circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's
debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from
discussions with dome's lenders, spokesman david annesley told
reuters in response to an inquiry.
    annesley said dome expects its debt will total between 6.3
billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by june 30, 1987, when it hopes to
implement the debt plan now under negotiation.
    annesley said dome petroleum would issue a statement
outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following
release of the plan to lenders.
    dome petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt
plan by mid-february in order to win agreement in principle
from creditors prior to june 30.
    the group of major lenders have agreed to defer a
substantial amount of debt payments until june 30 under an
interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with
cash flow generated by assets backing the loans.
    annesley also said there was no change in the status of
legal actions initiated by six swiss noteholders who are
seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt.
    together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 swiss
francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln swiss
franc denominated debt in default.
    annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a

"trans world airlines inc complicated
the bidding for piedmont aviation inc by offering either to buy
piedmont suitor usair group or, alternatively, to merge with
piedmont and usair.
    piedmont's board was meeting today, and wall street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from norfolk
southern corp and usair. the twa offer was announced shortly
after the piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    twa offered to buy usair for 52 dlrs cash per share. it
also said it was the largest shareholder of usair and
threatened to go directly to usair shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    twa also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
usair shareholders than an acquisition of piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    market sources and analysts speculated that twa chairman
carl icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    ""we're just wondering if he's not just trying to get twa
into play. there's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else,"" said one arbitrager. ""we think twa
might just be putting up a trial balloon.""
    analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by usair,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    they also said icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. ""they need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. i think it's a
credible offer,"" said timothy pettee, a bear stearns analyst.
    ""i think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals,"" said pettee. pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    usair stock soared after twa made public its offer. a
spokesman for usair declined comment, and said usair had not
changed its offer for piedmont. usair offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in usair stock.
    usair closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the twa action. piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from norfolk southern corp.
    norfolk southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for piedmont. norfolk owns about 20 pct of piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of piedmont.
    some analysts said icahn may be trying to acquire usair to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    ""icahn i think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. i think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. one way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines,"" said andrew kim of eberstadt fleming.
    ""i don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package,"" said kim.
    but icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of twa's heavy debt load.
    wall street sources said twa has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    the sources said icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy usx corp <x>
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    some wall street sources said the financier's usx plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, drexel burnham
lambert inc, because of wall street's insider trading scandal.
    industry sources also predicted usair might reject the twa
offer on price and financing concerns. ""it's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement,"" said one executive at another major airline.
    but the executive conceded a merged twa-usair would be a
strong contender with usair's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from psa. usair could feed the
intenrational flights of twa, which has a midwest presence in
its st. louis hub. adding piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    the combined entity would also have twa's pars reservation
system.
    such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

"sales of new cars by the u.s. auto
industry rose 6.7 pct in late february from the weak levels of
a year ago, but industry giant general motors corp <gm> was an
exception with an eight pct drop.
    the figures represented a slight recovery for the industry
from weak mid-february sales, but the eight domestic-based car
manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month
from last year.
    gm, whose sales have been weakening for several months,
took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the february 21-28
period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the
entire industry were depressed from the ending of major
marketing incentive campaigns.
    at the same time, rival ford motor co <f> said its car
sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and chrysler corp <c> was up
11.3 pct.
    the industry leader's slide was even more marked for the
full month as gm took only 37 pct of all car sales in february,
including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago.
    industry analysts said the 198,818 domestic-make cars sold
in the seven selling days of late february represented a
seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the
556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate.
    last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars,
including 8.2 mln domestic makes. but consumers have taken a
breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in
1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in december, a lack of
widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather,
analysts said.
    gm sales vice-president c.n. ""bud"" moore said in a
statement that his company's sales ""began their recovery from
the low point reached in january, and we expect the improvement
to continue in coming months.""
    anne knight, automotive analyst for paine webber and co,
told reuters that gm's sales were weak, but added: ""i think
sales will get better in the spring.""
    ""gm may make more production cuts in view of the weak
sales, but this may be a strike year so they might try to build
inventories,"" she said.
    in a further effort to revive sales, gm said its
oldsmobile, pontiac and buick divisions would offer many of
their new car lines through april 30 with discount loan
packages at rates ranging from 3.9 pct for 24-month contracts
to 9.9 pct for 60-month deals as an alternative to cash
rebates.
    among the smaller u.s.-based manufacturers, japanese-owned
american honda <hmc> said its late february car sales rose 96.2
pct from last year while japanese-owned nissan <nsany> was up
35.9 pct.
    german-owned volkswagen of america fell 42.5 pct, american
motors corp <amo> plunged 62.5 pct and japan's toyota <toyoy>
sold 1,082 domestic makes compared with none a year ago before
it started domestic production.
    detroit's late february truck sales were generally positive
with gm up 10.9 pct, ford up 48 pct, chrysler gaining 46 pct
and amc's jeep sales off 4.0 pct.
    imported cars sales, released monthly, were estimated at
219,300 in february, a 0.4 pct rise from last year and 28.3 pct
of the overall car market. that was lower than january's 31.4
pct share but above the 26.3 pct share a year ago.

"allis-chalmers corp said it asked
lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.
    the company said it would sell all of its businesses other
than the american air filter business, make a public financing
of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
outstanding debt with the proceeds.
    under the plan, which was presented to institutional
lenders, the company's unions and the pension benefit guaranty
corp, ""substantial amounts"" of institutional debt would be
converted to common stock of the restructured company.
    allis-chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
stock for common. the exchange of the institutional debt and
preferred stock for common equity will cause a ""resulting
dilution of the existing common stock,"" allis-chalmers said in
a statement.
    under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
15 pct of the restructured common stock. holders of existing
preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
    allis-chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
bankruptcy. the restructuring must be approved by creditors,
common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
    allis-chalmers said a bankruptcy filing ""appears to
represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
terms of the plan cannot be reached.""
    the spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
would result from the restructuring.
    ""it is too early to talk about a charge"" because the plan
must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
    also under the plan, payments to allis-chalmers' private
lenders would be deferred. trade payables and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
    payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
would be made ""at substantially reduced levels.""
    allis-chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to deutz
of west germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
and solid materials processing.
    last year, allis-chalmers sold the lift truck business to
ac material handling co of columbus, ohio.
    under the restructuring plan, allis-chalmers will sell its
solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
allis-chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
    the company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
which makes pumps and valves. that business accounted for 196
mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
    allis-chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,
or 1.09 dlrs a share. in 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,

vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. trw only
pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits
their financial interests,"" larry eagleye said in testimony at a
house oversight subcommittee hearing.
    eagleye was a controller at trw's compressor components
division in cleveland.
    subcommittee chairman john dingell, d-mich, said he did not
understand why the defense department had taken no action
against trw even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it
had substantially overcharged the government for military
aircraft parts.
    ""in 1984, trw officials admitted to the defense department
inspector general that they had evidence of two sets of books
and other problems in one of the company's divisions in

trw last year charging the company with overcharging the

"the u.s. army has delayed plans to
buy a european anti-aircraft missile to help protect u.s.
ground forces from soviet attack helicopters, defense
department officials said.
    the army has been considering buying some british rapier
missiles or french and german roland missiles as a stop-gap
partial replacement this year for the flawed u.s. sgt. york
division air defense (divad) gun which was canceled in 1985.
    despite recent indications by the service that it intended
to buy the missiles soon, defense officials told reuters a
final decision had been suspended because some army officials
favored a more versatile gun-missile combination.
    the gun-missile combination would open the competition wide
to u.s. firms.
    ""the missile option is on hold now and no decision has been
made,"" said one of the pentagon official, who asked not to be
identified.
    ""there is some sentiment to take things more slowly and see
if we can avoid a stop-gap system until we can come up with an
integrated system of our own,"" said another official.
    army lt. col. craig mcnab said, however, that ronald and
rapier ""are not out of the picture by a long shot.""
    there has been strong sentiment in the army to reject a
missile only and to opt for a more versatile combination gun
and missile system mounted on a tracked vehicle.
    such a move would throw the competition wide open to u.s.
firms, including general electric co <ge>, boeing co <ba>, fmc
corp <fmc> and martin marietta corp <ml>.
    but some pentagon officials have expressed fears that an
""off-the-shelf"" gun-missile combination could not be fielded
quickly enough.
     defense secretary caspar weinberger canceled the sgt. york
gun, made by ford motor co <f> aerospace and communications
corp, after the pentagon had already spent 1.8 billion dlrs on
the system and then decided it could not shoot down attack
helicopters at the proper range.

announcing it would divide the system into five different
components for the 1990s at a cost of more than 10 billion

chairman michel marks.
    ""energy futures trading is going through a tremendous
period of transition that will last five to 10 years,"" marks
said, adding that volume will soar, international participation
will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil
companies, and speculators will grow.
    marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when
board elections are held march 17. he will continue as chairman
of a long-range planning committee at nymex.
    ""the priority of the next 10 years is operational
efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product
development,"" said marks.
    marks said it is imperative for nymex, which is running out
of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in
order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that
are already planned.
    marks said crude futures volume could more than double by
the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined
products volume could soar to  100,000 contracts a day.
    much of the increased activity will come from the
international sector, according to marks. ""that's a huge growth
area,"" he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign
producer countries to foreign independent operators.
     he said it would be difficult to develop a futures
contract based on an internationally traded crude although he
previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.
    ""trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude
besides west texas intermediate will be a tough task"" he said.
     marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on
an international product rather than an international crude
will be developed since the products market is more diverse. he
said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of
developing a non-u.s. deliverable products contract.
    other sources of growth for u.s. energy futures are the
major oil companies, which already trade on the nymex, and
institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds,
and insurance companies, marks said.
    ""the commodities markets have become financial markets and
should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,""
marks said.

futures markets in the coming years from the current  share of
about 30 pct. hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70

"the rally wednesday in u.s. interest
rate futures left the treasury bond contract above the top of a
three month trading range which signals a bullish chart
breakout, financial analysts said.
    in addition, sluggish u.s. economic data and little sign
that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may
be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts
said.
    ""the market is paying more attention to the weakened state
of the economy right now,"" said refco analyst mike connery.
    connery said the four pct drop in january u.s. factory

the u.s. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be
forced to ease,"" thus paving the way for a more accomodative
u.s. credit policy, added john michael, analyst at first

deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major
industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.
    ""the surplus (for exporters to the u.s.) is bullish for
bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. rather
than translate those into their own currencies and suffer
exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,""
michael said.
    indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said
some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from

after the june bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.

keefe of technical data corp of boston. ""not only did bonds
close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways
pattern we've been in for the last three months.""
    also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the
june bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and
that the rally occurred on heavy volume, keefe said.

"president reagan, fighting to regain
public confidence in the wake of the iran arms scandal,
admitted tonight that the clandestine operation wound up as an
arms-for-hostages deal and, ""it was a mistake.""
    ""when it came to managing the nsc (national security
council) staff, let's face it, my style didn't match its
previous track record,"" reagan said in a television address to
the american people.
    ""i have already begun correcting this,"" he added in his
prepared remarks.
    reagan's speech, widely regarded as critical to his hopes
of repairing his presidency, was his first detailed response to
last week's scorching tower commission report on the secret
sale of arms to iran and diversion of profits to u.s.-backed
contra rebels in nicaragua.
    reagan said he had been silent on the scandal while he
waited for the truth to come out and admitted, ""i've paid a
price for my silence in terms of your trust and confidence.""
    he said that a few months ago, he told the american people
he did not trade arms for hostages in the 18-month covert
operation.
    ""my heart and my best intentions still tell me that is true,
but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not,"" reagan said.
    ""there are reasons why it happened, but no excuses. it was a
mistake,"" he said.
    reagan again said that the original iran initiative was to
develop relations with those who might assume leadership in a
post-khomeini government.
    ""it's clear from the board's report however that i let my
personal concern for the hostages spill over into the
geo-political strategy of reaching out to iran.
    ""i asked so many questions about the hostages' welfare that
i didn't ask enough about the specifics of the total iran plan,""
he said.
    the commission, headed by former republican sen. john
tower, said reagan's ""intense compassion"" for americans being
held by pro-iranian groups in lebanon had resulted in an
unprofessional and unsatisfactory policy.
    it portrayed 76-year old reagan as a man who did not know
or care much about the wide-ranging, probably illegal
activities of his national security council (nsc) staff, which
hatched the operation.
    reagan said he endorsed all of the tower commission's
recommendations about the running of the nsc, adding, ""in fact,
i'm going beyond its recommendations, so as to put the house in
even better order.""
    he noted that he had appointed former senate republican
leader howard baker as his new chief of staff and said he hoped
baker would help him forge a new partnership with congress,
""especially on foreign and national security policies.""
    he said his new national security adviser, frank carlucci,
was rebuilding the national security staff ""with proper
management discipline.""
    reagan said that almost half the nsc professional staff now
consisted of new people.
    he said that fbi director william webster, his new nominee
to head the cia, ""understands the meaning of 'rule of law'"".
    reagan also announced that tower had agreed to serve as a
member of his foreign intelligence advisory board, which acts
as a watchdog on the nation's covert activities.
    but he said that he had issued a directive barring the nsc
staff itself from undertaking covert operations -- ""no ifs,
ands, or buts.""
    tonight's speech was a far cry from reagan's initial strong
defense of his iran policy.
    in a televised speech last november 13, reagan called
charges that he ransomed hostages and undercut the u.s. war on
terrorism ""utterly false.""
    as recently as two months ago in his state of the union
speech, reagan said that ""serious mistakes were made"" but
defended the basic policy as one that had worthy goals.
    by contrast, tonight's speech had an apologetic tone that
was a marked departure from reagan's usual upbeat, confident
demeanor.
    he said he took full responsibility for his own actions ""and
for those of my administration.""
    ""as angry as i may be about activities undertaken without my
knowledge, i am still accountable for those activities. as
disappointed as i may be in some who served me, i am still the
one who must answer to the american people for this behavior,""
reagan said.
    reagan said the message that the nation should move on had
come from republicans and democrats in congress, from allies
around the world -- ""and if we're reading the signals right,
even from the soviets.""
    his remark seemed to be a reference to a new soviet
willingness to reach an agreement on eliminating medium-range
nuclear missiles in europe.

"the easing of rules governing overseas use
of the yen has caused an explosion of euroyen bond activity but
has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency,
bond managers and traders said.
    although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in
the eurobond market, few foreigners are interested in keeping
the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the
japanese, they said. this lack of real yen demand through the
freer euroyen market is undermining the 1984 u.s. and japanese
accord to internationalise the yen, they said.
    the borrowers want to take advantage of low japanese
interest rates but have no need for yen. they arrange primarily
with japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other
currencies, mainly dollars, bond managers said. more than 85
pct of euroyen bond issues are swap driven, they added.
    ""the borrowers don't care which currency they use. they are
only after attractive money,"" one bond trader said.
    issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous
year, boosting euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the
total eurobond market, koichi kimura, managing director of
daiwa securities co ltd, said recently.
    traders said some of the activity stems from battles among
japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the
prestige of placing a larger share of issues. many even resort
to ""harakiri"" swaps, those with unprofitable pricing.
    but the fever continues and the number of offerings could
double again in 1987, said naoki yokoyama, manager of nikko
securities co ltd's international capital markets operation.
    the euroyen bonds, once issued, are mostly picked up by
japanese trust banks, one trader said. after a 90 day waiting
period the bonds flow back to japan where investor appetite is
strong, he added.
    foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more
attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency
investments, traders said.
    ""even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing
(in yen),"" said masaki shimazu, manager of daiwa's bond
department.
    while few foreigners are interested in the secondary
market, japanese commercial banks, regional banks, life
insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the
bonds and await their flow back to japan since they offer
little currency risk, traders said.
    the finance ministry last april shortened the waiting
period before issues could flow back to japan to 90 days from
180. a ministry official said it verified through sampling that
reflow was fairly small.
    ""we believe the euroyen bond should remain mainly in the
euroyen market,"" he said.
    one trader said that although demand from japanese
investors is heavy, it may prove to be only short-term. he said
many investors plan to sell their bonds if japanese or u.s.
interest rates decline further.
    to encourage further international use of the yen, the
ministry is considering allowing the issue of euroyen
commercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying
demand from potential borrowers.
    securities company sources believe the ministry will permit
non-residents to issue euroyen commercial paper within the next
few months. but they expect it to continue to ban domestic
participation in the market for some time to come. japanese
banks object to the short-term paper market which they see
encroaching on their business territory.
    traders said euroyen commercial paper could spur more
demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift
into shorter-term securities if need be.
    ""commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps,"" one bond
manager said. if more financial instruments were available,
there might be more trades in yen, he added.
    euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though
some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if
they had shorter maturities, traders said.
    the ministry is expected to allow four-year euroyen bond
maturities within a few months.
    one yen bond manager said japanese financial authorities
are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules
governing international transactions of the yen. but freer use
of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the
japanese currency, he said. ""if exporters or importers can raise
funds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the
japanese yen as a settlement currency,"" he added.
    the finance ministry official said the government must
constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of
borrowers and investors. ""no major market can keep its status
without change,"" he said.

"the hongkong and shanghai banking corp
<hkbh.hk> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
share analysts polled by reuters said.
    their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion h.k. dlrs. results will be
announced on tuesday. the 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
    they forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
one-for-five bonus issue.
    analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
    the bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary hang seng bank ltd <hsgh.hk>
is to report its 1986 results on friday.
    analysts expect hang seng to announce net profit of more
than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
12 pct.
    they expect hang seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
    analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
hongkong bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
hong kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
    ""they benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
as their loan portfolio is well balanced,"" an analyst at mansion
house securities (f.e.) ltd said.
    government figures show that total loans and advances rose
by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
    loans to finance hong kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
pct in 1985.
    low interest rates also helped the bank. interest received
on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
but interest paid on savings was two pct. hongkong bank and
hang seng bank control half of all deposits in the banking
system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
    the strength of the real-estate market was another major
income source for the bank group. loans to finance property
development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
    ""the hongkong bank group is still the leader in mortgage
business despite tough competition from the bank of china group
and other foreign banks,"" one analyst said.
    the high level of activity on the capital and equities
markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in hongkong
bank subsidiaries wardley ltd <waia.hk> and <james capel and
co>, analysts said. ""wardley had a tremendous year acting as
financial adviser and underwriter,"" an analyst said.
    wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
flotation of <cathay pacific airways ltd>, of which hongkong
bank owned 30 pct at the time.
    the bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
for 1.57 billion dlrs. it also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
in <south china morning post ltd>, the larger of two
english-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
    the proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
    analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
need to write off bad debts. ""the need for provisions was much
lower than the year before,"" said tony measor of hong leong
securities co ltd. ""last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.""
    former hongkong bank chairman michael sandberg said the
bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
shipping exposure in 1985. lesley nickolds of county securities
asia ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. she
forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
    the bank's latin american exposure, mainly through its
51-pct owned marine midland banks inc <mm>, appears to have
improved substantially, analysts said. marine midland's 1986
fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln u.s. dlrs
from 89.2 mln a year before. its 1986 net profit rose to 145
mln u.s. dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

"the highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the u.s. dollar is obscuring the fact
that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major
european currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, japanese and european research officials said.
    the officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the group of five (g-5) industrial nations, told reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the japan-u.s. trade axis into a japan-
european community (ec) axis, to the discomfort of europe.
    in many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the september, 1985 new york plaza pact between
the u.s., japan, west germany, britain and france to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    the officials said that when the plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. the agreement
simply helped it on its way. senior ec financial expert in
tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely.
    ""you have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before plaza,"" he said.
    on february 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. on september 20, the friday before plaza, it was
242. since then, despite massive bank of japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen. the historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. the
european currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    the close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. in 1986, japanese imports and exports with the ec
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    last january, japanese exports to the ec totalled half of
of sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years.
    trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    ""the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europe that is
laying the golden egg,"" said de hora.
    the ec is worried. ec business also had a remarkable year
in japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total japan-u.s. trade.
    the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than
u.s. firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    ""this currency alignment between japan and the ec is
reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries. but
therefore, japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge,"" said azusa hayashi, director of the first international
economic affairs division of the foreign ministry. ""if you want
my objective view, i don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said.

"japanese creditor banks are close to a
decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they
will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable
debts owed by developing nations, international financial
sources told reuters.
    details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the
firm set up before the end of the month, they said.
    the scheme is intended to improve financial management at
the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts
turning bad, the sources said.
    last week's announcement by brazil that it would
indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68
billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted japanese
creditors to finalise the project, the sources said.
    major japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid
a debt crisis since the start of the year, they said.
    there are likely to be at least 10 participating banks, and
perhaps as many as 28, they said.
    about 30 japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans
totalling over 10 billion dlrs to brazil, accounting for about
15 pct of all commercial loans to that country.
    the most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the
caribbean tax haven of the cayman islands, the sources said.
    the idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with
participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock.
    the firm will then use the funds to buy from its
stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign
loans which are potentially bad, the sources said.
    the stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans.
    subject to the scheme would be loans extended to
debt-ridden countries such as mexico and argentina, they said.
    the financial sources said interest payments to the firm
would not be taxed because of its location. japanese banks have
asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss
reserves, but the ministry has not yet complied.
    a senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it
may encourage new lending to developing countries.
    the ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up
to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled
countries, but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting
for one pct of the loans.

"japan's ruling liberal democratic party
started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for
1987/88 through parliament, deepening a clash with the
opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable.
    in the absence of the opposition, ldp members of parliament
decided at a meeting of the lower house steering committee to
hold a public hearing on the draft budget on march 13 and 14,
parliamentary officials said.
    the step came after parliament resumed deliberations last
tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a
controversial government-proposed sales tax plan.
    four opposition parties led by the socialists have been
delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax
on which the budget plan is based.
    a socialist spokesman said the opposition would again
boycott parliament unless the ldp changed its mind.
    prime minister yasuhiro nakasone, who has vowed to push
through the tax reforms, told reporters: ""watching closely
negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, i would
like to avoid ... passing (the budget) singlehandedly.""
    the five pct tax, part of nakasone's tax reform plan, is
planned to start next january to help offset cuts in individual
income and corporate tax.
    the opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing
because the ldp could technically stop deliberations on the
budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a lower
house plenary session, political analysts said.
    the four opposition parties called the ldp move ""an
unforgivable, rash act"" and said they would fight to scrap the
sales tax.

"poland says u.s. sanctions have cost its
economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington
to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. some of them are ""too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
    but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    ""sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. they did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
    the u.s. imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured
nation (mfn) trading status from poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under
martial law. the estimated cost to the polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the institute of
national economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    according to one western envoy, an expert on polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the united states, as well as increases in
credits from western commercial and government lenders.
    but the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation.""
    a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to
the u.s. in the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the west. last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important
u.s. markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""poland is
accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons,"" said one expert. ""it's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of western economy.""
    ""there's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact
on poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    ""mfn doesn't really mean anything, only that poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. it will be difficult to
regain access to the u.s. market because different forces are
in play now,"" said one western envoy.
    he said polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the u.s., japan and europe would also hamper
poland's efforts to regain entry.
    deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently, ""making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... in a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
    while poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the u.s. which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. but a western economist said
""the argument that u.s. sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the polish economy won't cut any ice. the americans will
just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing
solidarity.""
    nevertheless, polish national bank head wladyslaw baka, in
talks in washington last week with the international monetary
fund (imf) and world bank, made it clear that poland was
looking for a lead from the united states.
    he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its
financial obligations to the united states, ""but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners.""
    he stressed that the u.s. ""had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of poland's partners
interested in the settlement of polish debt.""
    putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
washington for obstructing talks with the world bank, imf and
paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    ""as a major superpower the united states can influence
international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which western nations were prepared to cooperate.

"britain had a visible trade deficit of
2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
statistics show.
    seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the central
statistical office (cso) show the current account was in
deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
    for 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. billion shortfall and
a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
    preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. the fourth quarter
figure was in line with cso projections released on friday.
    the third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
    in 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
    the reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the cso
said.
    however, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
increased by 2.1 billion.
    the figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
    the cso stressed that figures for invisible transactions,
particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

"the bank of france is likely to cut its
money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
start of next week.  this follows a steady decline in the call
money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the finance
ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
    the call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
the meeting of finance ministers from the group of five
industrial countries and canada on february 22, which restored
considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
of turbulence.
    the call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on february
23, the day after the paris accord, and then edged steadily
down to eight pct on february 27 and 7-3/4 pct on march 3,
where it has now stabilised.
    dealers said the bank of france intervened to absorb
liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
    while call money has dropped by well over a percentage
point, the bank of france's money market intervention rate has
remained unchanged since january 2, when it was raised to eight
pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
    the seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on january 5.
    the bank of france has begun using the seven-day repurchase
rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
using the intervention rate to set the floor.
    sources close to finance minister edouard balladur said
that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
when the bank of france buys first category paper next monday,
although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
   a cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
    they said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
acceleration in foreign funds returning to france, discouraging
the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. but they also
pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
scope for a small fall in rates.
    m-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it

"opec crude oil output in the first few
days of march was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for february and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in december, a reuter survey shows.
    the figures were polled by reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in europe, the middle
east, africa, latin america and asia.
    they back recent statements by opec ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    opec output for the whole of february was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
united arab emirates and kuwait, the figures show.
    the uae, together with the much smaller producer ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of march, the
survey reveals.
    but such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in saudi arabian output, together with iran""s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    iraq rejected its opec quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in february and early march, the figures showed.
    saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early march from 3.5 mln bpd in february,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. the saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of neutral zone production.
    kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in february and 1.15 in
early march -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of neutral zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
opec states were reflected in output from qatar and nigeria,
both substantially under quota in february and early march.
    qatar's february output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early march compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    industry sources say japanese buyers are resisting qatar""s
prices and gulf arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow gulf state suffers.
    nigeria's early march output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in february and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.

"baker international corp said it has
filed suit in state court in houston to compel hughes tool co
to complete its proposed merger with baker.
    late yesterday, hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because baker would not agree to an alternative
divestiture plan devised by hughes.  hughes' board had
previously found unacceptable a u.s. justice department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from hughes of its objections to the provisions of the justice
department consent decree.
    hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    baker said the new terms that hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were ""more
burdensome"" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    it said its suit names as defendants hughes and certain of
its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing hughes to
live up to the merger agreement or ""substantial"" monetary
damages it did not name.
    baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
interests of shareholders of both companies.

"usair group inc said its board has
rejected trans world airlines inc's offer to acquire usair for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of usair shareholders, employees or passengers.
    the company said the unsolicited bid by the carl c.
icahn-led twa was ""highly conditional.""
    usair said its board and that of piedmont aviation inc
<pie> met separately yesterday to consider usair's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
usair common during a period just before the merger.
    the company said it is continuing talks with piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    usair said ""in light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the twa offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, usair group believes
that the purpose of the twa offer is to interfere with usair
group's proposed acquisition of piedmont.
    ""twa's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by carl
icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour usair group's acquisition
of piedmont, a transaction which the usair group board views as
most beneficial to usair group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which mr. icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests.""
    usair said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called twa's
last-minute attempt to interfere with usair group's acquisition
of piedmont.
    the company said conditions to the twa offer include twa
obtaining financing, the usair board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the ""fair
price"" provision contained in usair's charter inapplicable to
the twa offer and transportation department approval.

"the u.s. economy is facing several
serious problems which threaten its continued expansion,
according to a congressional report released today.
    the report by the democratic majority of the congressional
joint economic committee said the outlook was for sluggish
growth in the u.s. and the rest of the world for the near
future.
    committee republicans released a separate, more optimistic
report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation.
    democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee,
which is made up of 10 senators and 10 representatives.
    ""the annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion
dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger
signals that lie just below the surface,"" committee chairman
sen. paul sarbanes said in a statement.
    ""a close inspection of the economy reveals that the current
recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin
ice,"" the maryland democrat said.
    he said the danger signals included a decline in
investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining
the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled
by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the
nation's farmers.
    republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood
of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around
three pct for this year and next, similar to administration
forecasts.
    ""the economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. we're
comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful
that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that
employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident
in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,""
the republican report said.
    ""the greatest economic challenge facing the 100th congress
is reducing the federal deficit,"" the republicans added.
    democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but
also wanted the government to spend more on education, job
training, research and development and health care.
    they said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult
for the federal reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the
economy if this becomes necessary.
    ""there is now substantial concern about the inflationary
effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary
pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money
supply,"" the democrat report said.
    ""at the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources
of capital in american investment markets means that the
federal reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past
in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down.""
    ""taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy
is thus not very encouraging,"" the democrats said.
    the democrats called on the administration to be more
aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking
new initiatives to solve the international debt problem.
    the democrats said much of the u.s. trade deficit had been
caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially
the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982.
    both democrats and republicans called for policies to
increase american productivity including incentives for saving
and investment in plant and equipment and development of a
better educated work force.

"jaguar plc <jagr.l> is about to sell its
new xj-6 model on the u.s. and japanese markets and expects a
strong reception based on its success in the u.k., chairman sir
john egan told a news conference.
    commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
below 1985's 121.3 mln, egan said jaguar aimed at an average
profit growth of 15 pct per year. however, the introduction of
the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
    jaguar starts selling xj-6 in the u.s. in may and plans to
sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
    u.s. sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
finance director john edwards said.
    a u.s. price for the car has not been set yet, but edwards
said the relatively high car prices in dollars of west german
competitors offered an ""umbrella"" for jaguar. he added the xj-6
had also to compete with u.s. luxury car producers which would
restrict the car's price.
    jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
its receipts for longer periods, john egan said.
    in the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
pct of net sales. research and development will cost four pct
of net sales and training two pct.
    jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
other half. the firm is in early stages of considering the
building of an own press shop in britain for about 80 mln stg,
but egan said this would take at least another three years
    on the london stock exchange, jaguar's shares were last
quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after

"enzon inc said a new
treatment using its investigational new drug peg-ada has
restored the functioning of the immune system in the first two
children that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine
deaminase.
    the disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency
disease, or ""bubble boy disease""
    bubble boy disease is a rare but severe disease that
hampers the development of the immune system. it has killed
most of its victims before adulthood.
    children with the disease are consigned to live in a
sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid
infection, the company said.
    the study of enzon's drug, conducted at duke university,
showed that two children suffering from the disease were
treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of
serious infection during that time, the company said. the
results were published in the new england journal of medicine.
    the disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called adenosine
deaminase, or ada, that is crucial to the development of the
immune system.
    enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme
with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or peg, serving to
disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,
preventing rejection.
    ""marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function
occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of
t-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before
treatment with peg-ada had begun,"" the study said.
    ""the children are now more active and have begun to gain
weight and height. before treatment their growth had been very
poor in comparison to normal children of the same age,"" the
study, conducted by doctors michael hershfield and rebecca
buckley, said.
    the peg-ada injections were given once a week. victims of
the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow
transplants, but for most, donors are not available or
transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. other
diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by
introducing a peg coated enzyme, the article noted.

"congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured u.s. farmers and miners.
    with a record u.s. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last
year and a farm economy in the doldrums, congress is pressing
to hold back u.s. funds for the world bank and other
development banks if the money is used to subsidize production
or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
     ""american tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers,"" senator don nickles, an
oklahoma republican, said in a letter to fellow senators
seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.
    nickles and senator steven symms, a conservative republican
from idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit u.s. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    current law requires that the united states vote against
such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately
approved by the banks.
    treasury secretary james baker's assurances that u.s.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two senate committee hearings last week.
    baker told a senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, ""as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply.""
    the senators cited a 350-mln-dlr world bank loan made to
argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    nickles, symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 world bank loan to hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture.
    last year the republican-controlled senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut u.s.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    but even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,
the restrictions were weakened in the final version. only a
provision directing u.s. officials to vote disapproval cleared
congress.
    this year's version, called the foreign agricultural
investment reform (fair) act would require the u.s. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals. also, the recipient countries would
have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the
commodities could be handled without government subsidy.
    if the loan is approved over u.s. objections, the united
states would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative republicans who have traditionally opposed u.s.
funding for these international development banks.
    but the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    the administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. it argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward u.s. policies in other areas.
    baker said the united states would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.
    two house republicans, representatives larry craig of idaho
and beau bolter of texas, have introduced the bill. but it
faces stiff opposition in the house banking committee which has
blocked its consideration by the house in the past.
    symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any
related legislation this year, an aide said.

"royal dutch/shell group <rd.as> earnings
for 1986 from the u.s. fell sharply because of difficult market
conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to
different accounting methods, shell chairman peter holmes said.
    the shell oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,
while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.
    the group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with
lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
volume.
    although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at
the top end of market forecasts. shell transport and trading
plc <sc.l> shares, the u.k. arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg
from a close last night of 11.06 stg. analysts noted that a
general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
stg from 205 mln in 1985.
    also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
forecasts, industry analyst chris rowland of barclays de zoete
wedd noted.
    however, he added there could well be a sharp fall in
performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the
improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.
    the impact of recovering oil prices would come through
faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which
typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year
lag, analysts said.
    holmes said that in the upstream u.s. sector the third
quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.
    only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
the period, with shell oil being one of them. the decrease in
u.s. earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
had increased share to become volume market leader, holmes
added.
    continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
u.s. exploration activity. ""exploration is currently pretty
flat. we are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no
massive upturn,"" he said.
    a renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the north
sea and the u.s. requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.
    ultimately this would lead to a rise in u.s. imports. ""if
you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,"" he
noted.
    u.s. oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
below 20 dlrs a barrel.
    this favored opec's attempts to stabilise prices, as the
lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-opec
marginal production shutting down. ""opec has done pretty
extraordinarily well...everything is moving in (its) direction,""
he added.

the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured american farmers and miners.
    with a record trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year
and a farm economy in the doldrums, congress is pressing to
hold back u.s. funds for the world bank and other development
banks if the money is used to subsidize production or to
produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
    ""american tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers,"" sen. don nickles, an oklahoma
republican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support
for his legislation to limit these loans.
    nickles and sen. steven symms, a conservative republican
from idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit u.s. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    current law requires the united states to vote against such
loans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.
    treasury secretary james baker's assurances that u.s.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two senate committee hearings last week.
    baker told a senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations, ""as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply.""
    the senators cited a 350 mln dlr world bank loan made to
argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    nickles, symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 world bank loan to hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture. baker said the argentine
loan was ""really the only one you can point to and criticize.""
    last year the republican-controlled senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut u.s.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions
were weakened in the final version. only a provision directing
u.s. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.
    this year's proposal, called the foreign agricultural
investment reform (fair) act would require the u.s. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals.
    also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the
production, marketing and export of the commodities could be
handled without government subsidy.
    if the loan is approved over u.s. objections, the united
states would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative republicans who have traditionally opposed u.s.
funding for these international development banks.
    but the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    democratic senator barbara mikulski of maryland told baker
at the senate appropriations subcommittee hearing, ""many say the
banks are financing competition for american jobs.""
    she recommended that the united states use its
participation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans
as a wedge to open markets to u.s. goods.
    the administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. it argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward u.s. policies in other areas.
    baker said the united states would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.

a decision soon on how to change the current u.s. soybean loan
or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the
government and foreign soybean production will increase, the
president of the american soybean association, asa, said.
    ""the usda will have to bite the bullet one way or another
... usda can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as
much as they want, but they have to eventually address this
problem,"" david haggard, asa president, told reuters.
    usda is not offering any new soybean loan options, and
agriculture secretary richard lyng has not consulted asa on the
soybean loan, haggard said.
    ""i don't know if usda is really very serious about
addressing the soybean loan problem,"" he said.

leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan
-- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.
    the association backs current bills of rep. bill emerson,
r-mo. and sen. thad cochran, r-miss., which call for either a
5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.
    haggard said he does not know what chances the asa-backed
proposals have but said, ""in all honesty, we do not want to see
the farm bill be torn apart.""
    he said if usda feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to
a market loan, there are still numerous ways the usda could
change the loan without new legislation.
    making the loan partially in certificates which would not
have to be paid back would be one option, he said.

"britain appeared set for a new cash row
with its european community partners as evidence emerged that
it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to
radically alter the way the ec is financed.
    analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released
yesterday by the ec's executive commission showed their full
impact, were they in force this year, would have left britain
worse off by 545 mln european currency units.
    the proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member
government after a debate expected to open next month.
    the commission said they were necessary to prevent the ec
from sliding once again into bankruptcy, and has described the
current financing system as unfair and unacceptable.
    british dissatisfaction with the cost of ec membership has
long been a source of friction, and diplomats said the
proposals could well reopen the wound.
    this was despite a proposed correction of britain's budget
contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of
the ec's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small
size of its agricultural sector.
    diplomats said although other nations such as italy,
belgium and the netherlands were certain to oppose elements in
the system which could also substantially increase their own ec
payments, the main opposition was expected from britain.
    prime minister margaret thatcher has made clear in recent
statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present
system, under which britain is refunded two-thirds of its net
payments to the ec, unless a fairer system is devised.
    the diplomats said thatcher was unlikely to consider the
proposed system as fair.
    the commission's proposals would base a state's
contribution on its gross national product, which the
commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative
wealth.
    the main element of the previous system was a share of
value added tax collected in member states.
    the mechanism to compensate britain for its inability to
take up a higher proportion of ec farm expenditure will have to
be paid for by the other 11 states.
    the commission has also proposed to end repayments to all
states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs
duties on behalf of the ec.

"opec output in february was ""well below""
the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in december and all countries
are strictly adhering to their quotas, the opec news agency
opecna quoted an opec secretariat official as saying.
    the official was quoted as saying that lower output was the
result ""of member countries' firm determination to defend the
organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to
refrain from selling any quantity below that price.""
    the unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no
opec meeting was foreseen before the next biannual opec session
planned to start on june 25.
    the official gave no figure for february output. the
statement said only that ""the reduction in total supplies,
namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local
deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as
those supplies fell very noticeably during that month.""
    ""no matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters
to align the official selling price to the ongoing market
price, member countries are, without exception, strictly
adhering to the official selling price in spite of the
financial hardship this may entail,"" the statement said.
    ""the very recent improvement in the price structure is an
indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to
the official selling price,"" the statement said.
    free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a
barrel in early december last year to near opec's official
levels towards the end of the year, after the opec pact.
    there has been oil industry speculation that opec might
have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled
june session to discuss reports of overproduction by some
states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices
each opec crude according to its quality and distance from main
markets.
    the official said in the statement that no such emergency
session was scheduled ""because of member countries' firm
determination to defend the price (system)"" agreed in december.
    opec""s differential committee was to have met in vienna
starting april 2 but this session has been postponed, with no
new date set, according to an official of the united arab
emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.
    other members are algeria, kuwait, saudi arabia, libya,

"a study of salmonella poisoning has
uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding
antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that
can infect humans and resist medicines.
    researchers at the federal centers for disease control
tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is
resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the
resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote
the growth of cattle.
    cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of
antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. but critics have
been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs
is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.
    industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases
that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect
humans.
    but the new study, reported in thursday's new england
journal of medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.
    the research team, led by dr. john spika, said the number
of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant
infection in los angeles county alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to
298 the following year. two of those victims died and half the
victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized
for their illness.
    they also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always
prevent the disease. only 15 pct of the victims reported eating
raw, infected hamburger. thus, the researchers concluded, ""the
majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating
hamburger that was at least partially cooked.""
    the researchers said the results show that ""food animals are
a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections
in humans, and that these infections are associated with
(antibiotic) use on farms.""

    in a wide ranging address sponsored by the export-import

that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.

against the yen,"" he said.

is still a little bit undervalued,"" and ""could go up another 10
or 15 pct.""
    in addition, ortner, who said he was speaking personally,
said he thought that the dollar against most european
currencies was ""fairly priced.""
    ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate
values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate
differentiations.
    ortner said there had been little impact on u.s. trade
deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the
plaza accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the
first 15 pct decline had little impact.
    he said there were indications now that the trade deficit
was beginning to level off.
    turning to brazil and mexico, ortner made it clear that it
would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough
foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  he said
the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined

calculating first quarter results.

172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.

loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal

income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.

213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
non-interest expenses and income taxes.
    the bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
    return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100

but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.

"the bank of england again fought against
money and bond market pressure for a pre-budget interest rate
cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
    it closed at its best level since september 12, at 71.4 pct
of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
    meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the bank can
stop a cut before budget day, march 17, and why it should want
to.
    the bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
relieve a money market shortage.
    ""they're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said
stephen lewis, economist at brokerage house phillips and drew.
""eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.""
    this money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
inhibited strong rises yesterday and tuesday, so buyers came
strongly into the pound.
    the pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the london
close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
marks, up from 2.8720/50.
    ""if this pressure keeps up...there is a possibility that
rates could drop before the budget,"" said jeremy hale, economist
at finance house goldman sachs international corp.
    some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
    however, analysts said the bank of england will need to be
convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
    there are valid reasons for the bank to be cautious, said
peter fellner, u.k. economist at brokers james capel and co.
    markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
a conservative party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if prime minister margaret thatcher decides to
hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
for bonds, fellner said.
    an election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year.
    others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
    however, analysts agree the bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
    the authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
    some add the bank will be influenced by signs that at least
a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
capital coming into the london market, notably from japan.
    they argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
current political upheavals in washington.
    the bank may want to see another few points on the
trade-weighted index before the budget, argued lewis. ""but by
then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the bank of
england,"" he added.
    the bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
    meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
    this was above previous estimates of the current account
deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
    fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
    the guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
banks divided as well as the markets. privately, some bank
officials forecast the bank will hold out at least for this
week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
if a move comes before march 17, forecasts are for a half-point
cut, with another half or full point about budget day.

said its counter proposal to merge with baker international
corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    ""our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies,"" kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
company. ""we're working very hard on this merger.""
    hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for march 11
to give baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
    the hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
about a u.s. department of justice consent decree that would
require baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    the hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    the directors of baker immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in texas in a texas state
court to force to hughes to complete the merger.
    ""the uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the department of justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be,"" kistler said, in explaining
why hughes had made the counter proposal.
    ""we need additional time to understand why baker did not
accept our proposal.""
    kistler also said that the law suit filed by baker ""was not
a factor"" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    he declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    kistler said hughes would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    the justice department in january said it would block the
hughes and baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    the hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too ""unreasonable."" hughes said that baker should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    under the decree, if baker is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    he also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    baker said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

"the french government is to
sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in societe
generale <stgn.pa>'s regional bank subsidiary <societe generale
alsacienne de banque>, sogenal, from next monday, sogenal
officials said.
    sogenal, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
leading french regional bank and has branches in austria,
belgium, luxembourg, east and west germany and switzerland.
    chairman rene geronimus told a news conference the share
offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by finance
minister edouard balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
    societe generale, which will itself be privatised later
this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
bank, chairman marc vienot said.
    sogenal officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
    sogenal's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
francs in new funds. its shares will be divided by eight,
giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
    the bank will be listed on the nancy stock exchange, in
line with the finance ministry and government's aim of a
regional operation, geronimus said.
    he said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. ten
pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
with the rest offered to the public. there will not be a share
reserved for foreign investors. ""this is too small an operation
and anyway they will be able to buy shares in france,"" he said.
    stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
120 francs would value sogenal at 1.5 billion francs.
    geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
apart from the opening soon of a basle branch.
    sogenal is the only french bank in austria, it set up the
first foreign exchange dealing room outside paris at its
strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign
banking subsidiary to be a broker on the zurich bourse.

"u.s. retailers posted stronger than
expected sales in february, but not enough to prompt analysts
to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
first half of 1987.
     ""my feeling is that it (february) borrowed some of the
business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
half of 1987,"" said bear stearns and co analyst monroe
greenstein.
    ""i don't think march will be as strong because easter falls
in april this year,"" said morgan stanley analyst walter loeb.
   analysts generally average the sales results of march and
april to account for the variation of easter's occurrence.
    analyst edward johnson of johnson redbook associates said
sales for february rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
3.6 pct increase last year.
     analysts noted that february is considered a small,
transitory month between winter and spring.
    in addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
especially soft february last year which was adversely affected
by severe weather.
    apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
according to retailers and analysts.
    ""february's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
tax reductions,"" said greenstein of bear stearns.
    analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
high levels of consumer debt.
     may department stores co <may> and k mart corp <km> were
among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. may had an overall
sales gain of 15.0 pct and k mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
last month.

strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
    store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
from good in the east to weak in the depressed southwest.

critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the
world and said that progress was being made.
    ""it is worth reiterating that the federal reserve's
promotion of price stability is critical to the successful
implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients
for growth,"" he told the eastern economic association.
    johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of
fronts. ""federal reserve monetary policy, the
gramm-rudman-hollings legislation, the g-6 agreement, and the
baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the
right direction,"" he said. g-6 is comprised of u.s., britain,
france, japan, west germany and canada.

numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment
toward slowing the growth of federal spending.
    there was evidence deficits as a pct of gross national
product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.
    but johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign
capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep
interest rates stable.
    ""this situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.
sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive
federal spending,"" he said.
    a disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the
main objective of the fed, johnson said.
    he also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of
exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.
    on the trade deficit, johnson warned against ""quick fix""
solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation
or protectionist trade legislation.
    ""what is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy
returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine
economic growth,"" he said.
    such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow
for its gradual resolution over time.

told the house select revenue measures subcommittee.

that will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injured
persons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities for
vaccine manufacturers,"" dennis ross, tax legislative counsel for

    the vaccine act was signed into law last year but did not
include a funding mechanism for its compensation program.
    ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer serious
long-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine for
diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.
    but he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like wyeth
laboratories and parke, davis and co to stop producing
childhood vaccines.
    the administration would not favor funding compensation
through an excise tax levied on the vaccine producers because
it would add to collection and auditing burdens, ross said.
    he did not suggest a favored funding mechanism but said
a lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable.

"a reduction of the u.s. federal budget
deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge
trade deficit, u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said.
    speaking to the new york chamber of commerce and industry,
yeutter said ""capital and trade flows are clearly
inter-releated now.
    ""unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the
trade deficit down.""
    he did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between
the two deficits.
    private analysts have said that the financing of large u.s.
budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas
investors through purchases of u.s. treasury and, to a lesser
extent, other u.s. securities as well.
    ""we'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr
trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,""
yeutter said.
    he said the problem must be approached on many fronts and
focus most strongly on u.s. and overseas fiscal and monetary
policies to foster economic growth, u.s. competitiveness and
the establishment of a ""level playing field"" for trade.
    the u.s. trade representative said the federal reserve
under chairman paul volcker has done its part to improve the
trade situation by getting interest rates down.
    on the fiscal side, yeutter said ""the budget deficit is
still our biggest problem"" and there has not been enough
progress toward reducing that deficit.
    in the international area, he said that ""our major trading
partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth.""
commenting on japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr
trade surplus with the united states, yeutter said ""japan is
just not doing the job on the import side.""
    yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the
dollar made earlier today by commerce dept undersecretary of
economic affairs robert ortner.
    in a washington address to an export-import bank sponsored
meeting, ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels
was fairly priced against most european currencies, but that
the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.
    ""the market will determine the dollar's proper value in the
end,"" yeutter said. however, he added that, if the u.s. and
other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the u.s.
trade deficit, ""the dollar will be the equalizer.""
    yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and
any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation
or trade restrictions poses real dangers.
    he said ""there's relatively little that congress can do to
legislate a solution to the trade problem.""
    protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by
u.s. trading partners, yeutter said.
    ""there is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our
trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade
legislation,"" yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is
essential in solving international trade problems.

"the highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the u.s. dollar is obscuring the fact
that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major
european currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, japanese and european research officials said.
    the officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the group of five (g-5) industrial nations, told reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the japan-u.s. trade axis into a japan-
european community (ec) axis, to the discomfort of europe.
    in many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the september, 1985 new york plaza pact between
the u.s., japan, west germany, britain and france to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    the officials said that when the plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. the agreement
simply helped it on its way. senior ec financial expert in
tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely.
    ""you have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before plaza,"" he said.
    on february 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. on september 20, the friday before plaza, it was
242. since then, despite massive bank of japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen. the historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. the
european currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    the close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. in 1986, japanese imports and exports with the ec
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    last january, japanese exports to the ec totalled half of
of sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years.
    trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    ""the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europe that is
laying the golden egg,"" said de hora.
    the ec is worried. ec business also had a remarkable year
in japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total japan-u.s. trade.
    the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than
u.s. firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    ""this currency alignment between japan and the ec is
reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries. but
therefore, japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge,"" said azusa hayashi, director of the first international
economic affairs division of the foreign ministry. ""if you want
my objective view, i don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said.

protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
washington's special 32-year exemption from certain gatt rules
on agricultural trade.
    robert arnott, australia's delegate to the general
agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt), made the appeal at a
special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 u.s. waiver.
    ""australia today said the united states' goals of reducing
u.s. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
agriculture,"" the australian delegation said in a statement.
    ""the united states section 22 waiver is one of the basic

close the u.s. sugar market to imports.

peanuts, cotton and sugar.

"volkswagen ag <vowg.f> expects
currency factors to cause a further drop in its u.s. sales in
1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the united states in
1986, board member karl-heinz briam said.
    briam, who described the current situation of the u.s.
market as critical, also said vw was uncertain whether it would
be able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 european sales.
    in 1986 the vw group, which includes audi ag <nsug.f>,
delivered a record 981,000 vehicles to european markets outside
of west germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, briam told a
regular quarterly meeting of the wolfsburg plant's workforce.
    briam said sales conditions in europe had generally become
more difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates and
fiercer competition in the region.
    briam gave no forecast for vw domestic sales. but he said
car sales in west germany for all manufacturers combined would
probably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record
2.73 mln because car sales in west germany had likely passed
their peak for this business cycle.
    summing up his predictions, briam said limits to growth
were becoming apparent on the vw group's most important markets
but there were no grounds for great worries.
    the automobile industry, as far as vw was concerned, had
entered its fourth consecutive good year, with vw's incoming
orders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said.
    briam, who is vw's director of labour relations, also said
vw currently had no plans for further increases in its
workforce.
    he told the plant's workforce that an
internationally-active company like vw must be able to adjust
to changed economic conditions and manage situations in which
unfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financial
maneuver.
    briam said vw needed to hold and expand market share in
order to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some of
its foreign competitors, particularly those in the far east.
    this could only be done if capital-intensive plants were
used as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications were
raised through comprehensive training and if working hours were
arranged so that expensive production plants operated as
efficiently and soundly as possible.
    the metalworkers union ig metall has said it plans to push
for a 35-hour working week in its sector of west germany
industry this year.
    walter hiller, the chairman of vw's works council, told the
same wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35
hours was necessary to help reduce unemployment.
    he said the works council was prepared to negotiate on
making working hours more flexible to suit the needs of both
the company and the workforce.
    a seven-week strike by ig metall in the summer of 1984 for
a 35-hour week in the west german metal industry ended in a
compromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed each
company in the industry to decide, in consultation with the
workforce, how the reductions should be made.

"a house agriculture committee meeting
later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
""de-coupling,"" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, congressional sources
said.
    the disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
wheat crop. the bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    the administration has strongly urged that the bill be
expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
    it is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
    proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
    opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
the bill, committee staffers said.
    the 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 est. a
conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
    such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends march 30.
    farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
implemented, an agriculture department source said.
    an expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
chairman dan glickman, d-kan., saying that more study of the
consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
necessary.
    major commodity groups, including the national corn
growers, the american farm bureau and the national cattlemen's
association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
    but proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
should be extended to other crops.
    there will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
gene moos, aide to house majority leader tom foley, d-wash.
    projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
debate to expand the 0/92 application, moos said.
    rep. charles stenholm, d-tex., may be planning to introduce
a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
changes in the farm bill.
    ""stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
timing,"" a congressional staff member said.
    rep. arland stangeland (r-minn.) is reported to have an
amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
feedgrains.

"carl icahn's bold takeover bid for
usair group <u> has clouded the fate of piedmont aviation inc,
which was being courted by usair.
    yesterday, icahn's transworld airlines inc <twa> made a 1.4
billion dlr offer for usair group. the move complicated a usair
takeover offer for piedmont, which was believed to be close to
accepting the bid.
    today, usair rejected icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
takeover of piedmont. icahn was unavailable for comment.
    piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. twa was
off 3/8 to 31-1/2. usair fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
it would be taken over.
    analysts and market sources view the twa bid as an attempt
to either trigger a counter offer from usair or to attract a
suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
   ""the next move is either icahn starts a tender offer or
piedmont and usair announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager.
    some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
price of piedmont since it is not clear that usair's bid will
succeed.
    piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, norfolk
southern corp <nsc> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
company. usair offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
    some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
destined to be acquired by someone. usair, they said, is the
least likely to be bought.
    icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
the airline industry, also offered usair the alternative of a
three-way airline combination, including twa and piedmont.
    but wall street has given little credibility to icahn's
offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
contingencies.
    still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with twa.
    ""you can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager.
    analysts, however, said icahn would have to prove he is
serious by following through with his threats or making a new
offer. in making the offer for usair, icahn threatened to go
directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
price if usair rejected his offer.
    ""it's clear icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" said
one arbitrager.
    analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
about six dlrs per share.
    some analysts believe icahn's proposed three-way airline
combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
acquired separately.
    ""twa would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
work,"" said one analyst.
    analysts said such a merger would be costly and
complicated. twa has the best cost structure, since icahn
succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
    in order for the other carriers to come down to twa's wage
scale in a merger, twa would have to be the surviving entity,
analysts said.
    such a move does not necessarily free icahn of twa, they
said. they said he showed skill in reducing ozark airlines'
costs when he merged it into twa last year, and he might be a
necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
    however, other analysts speculated the managements of
piedmont and usair would not tolerate icahn as head of a new
company. they said a usair acquisition of twa might be a way
for him to exit the company if usair's airline is then merged
into twa.

"opec conference president rilwanu lukman
said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling it set in december, partly because liftings had been
delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed opec
prices.
    lukman, during a brief visit to london on his way home from
jamaica, told reuters in a telephone interview that in
february, opec had underproduced partly because members were
strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they
were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official
prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    ""we are determined to stand firm by the (december) accord,""
he said. ""i have spoken to every other opec minister and they
are committed to making the accord work,"" he said.
    lukman gave no specific figures for february output. he
said the opec secretariat in vienna was finalizing these
figures.
    told of a reuters survey published today which estimated
that opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he
said; ""that could well be correct.""
    opec""s news agency opecna today issued a statement saying
group output was ""well below"" its ceiling in february. but it
gave no figures.
    but one source close to opec indicated that february output
may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.
    the reuter survey estimated opec february output at around
16 mln bpd.
    opec agreed in december to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8
mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting february 1.
    lukman said qatar, nigeria, saudi arabia and iran had all
produced in february below their opec quotas. iraq, which said
it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the december
pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.
    lukman said that some industry reports ""may be correct"" that
in february, nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238
mln bpd quota, saudi arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln
allocation and qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.
    he said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his
country were coming under price pressure because they were
currently officially priced above sweet north sea grades and
the united states"" west texas intermediate (wti) crude.
    however, he said opec in december had anticipated that
demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons
and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.
    ""we have to be patient for two or three weeks. the market is
now firming on actual fundamentals,"" he said, adding that he
expected it to go ""up and up"" even beyond official prices after
early april. this is when, traditionally, there is more demand
for gasoline-rich crudes such as nigeria""s.
    the opec president said producers such as kuwait, venezuela
and indonesia were having less problems with output than
producers like his own country because they exported oil
products.
    also, some of venezuela""s heavy grades were outside the opec
pricing system, he said.
    lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift
some opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks
and ran them down to ""dangerous levels,"" they would eventually
have to buy opec oil.
    ""when they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)
they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more
later on,"" he said.
    lukman, asked about industry reports that nigeria was being
pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was
important to know that terms with them were negotiable,
flexible and under constant review, not only when the market
seemed weak.
    he said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation
ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that
such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority
for opec at the moment.
    ""at this time, we have to get our priorities right,"" he said.
""the most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is
working, not dealing with a differential of cents between
grades.""
    but if any opec member raised concerns or objections over
the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.

"top u.s. and european farm trade and
government representatives called for a sweeping reform of
world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
imbalance.
    speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here
demonstrated a growing u.s.-european consensus on the need for
an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
production.
    ""it is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the
disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of
protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
become more harmful,"" u.s. department of agriculture deputy
administrator william bailey said.
    bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which
ends tomorrow, demonstrated the u.s. recognises the need to
adjust its policies to the changing market environment.
    the need for urgent reforms is justified by the ""imbalance
and tensions of the world economy,"" the secretary general of the
organisation for economic cooperation and development
jean-claude paye said.
    and the forum for such a reform is the general agreement on
tariffs and trade, he noted.
    paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
to help farmers in unprofitable areas.
    another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and
instead help farmers through income support and adjustment
aids, proposed james howard, executive vice-president of
cargill (usa), one of the world's largest cereal houses.
    franz-josef feiter, agricultural adviser to west german
chancellor helmut kohl, agreed the european community must take
greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.
    however, ""differentiated policy treatment is required"" to
take account of large disparities in the situation around the
ec, he said.
    ""agriculture is an efficient sector of the european economy
and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
community,"" he said.

(d-wash.) has urged congress to give the farm credit system a
few more months to reorganize itself before rushing into a
federal rescue of the system, a senior aide to foley said.
    gene moos, agricultural aide to the majority leader, told
reuters while foley believes action will be necessary later
this year to rescue the system, a bail-out package is not
necessarily needed immediately.
    foley's view appears to differ with the senate leadership
who have said they hope to have farm credit legislation under
consideration before congress breaks for easter april 9.
    sen. david boren (d-okla.) chairman of the senate
agriculture subcommittee responsible for the farm credit issue,
last week pledged to consider a bill before easter. boren said
his subcommittee would proceed even if neither the system's
regulator, the farm credit administration (fca) nor the system
itself ask for aid.
    chairman of the fca frank naylor, like foley, has 
expressed caution about rushing to a bail-out, prefering to
wait a few months and keep pressure on the system to reform
itself, farm credit sources said.
    ""he (foley) is willing to give mr. naylor some time in this
regard,"" moos said.
    moos predicted congress will begin serious action on a
rescue package sometime this summer. any package of legislation
is unlikely to include large federal outlays of money, he said.
    ""i  don't see a big infusion of federal bucks,"" said moos,
adding that the more likely outcome will be federal guarantees
of borrower stock and bonds held by investors.

"delegates from the national pork
producers council, nppc, attending the american pork congress
in indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the u.s.
congress not to change the farm bill. while there are no
specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices
directly affect pork producer profits, the nppc said.
    don gingerich, a delegate from iowa, said ""to have
unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very
difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption.""
    other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but
that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for
legislative stability, an nppc spokesman said.
    delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that
congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify
problems in the farm credit system.
    farm credit task force chairman and newly elected vice
president of the nppc ray hankes, said delegates wanted a
program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a 
resolution to this problem with legislators in washington.
    hankes added that the national pork producers council will
work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save
or create any one credit system.
