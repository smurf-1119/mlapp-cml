"Evaluation of 99Tcm Technegas ventilation scintigraphy in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
 In the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, perfusion lung scintigraphy offers high sensitivity but low specificity.
 The specificity can be significantly increased by the use of combined ventilation and perfusion studies.
 Most aspects of perfusion lung scintigraphy are uniformly accepted but the technique of ventilation imaging varies from centre to centre.
 This study describes a new technique for the performance of ventilation scintigraphy using a suspension of ultrafine carbon particles labelled with 99Tcm (""Technegas"").
 The technique combines the ready availability of 99Tcm and its optimal imaging properties with an easily administered radiopharmaceutical of particle size sufficiently small to deposit in the alveoli.
 Of 63 patients studied by conventional perfusion scintigraphy plus Technegas ventilation scintigraphy, images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all.
 31 of these patients also had a ventilation study using 81Krm gas and in only one instance did the two methods of ventilation imaging lead to differing interpretations.
 We conclude that high quality diagnostic images may be obtained using this new technique, which can be made available on both a routine and an emergency basis, thus improving the service provided for patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism.

"Cardiorespiratory effects of pressure controlled ventilation in severe respiratory failure.
 Cardiorespiratory values were measured in ten patients with severe respiratory failure on volume controlled and pressure controlled ventilation.
 Tidal volume, respirator rate, PEEP, auto-PEEP, inspiratory:expiratory ratio (1:2) and FIo2 were maintained at the same value for both ventilatory modalities.
 Changing from VCV to PCV was associated with significant improvements in PaO2, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygen consumption.
 Peak inspiratory pressure fell.
 There were no significant changes in other cardiorespiratory values, such as arterial blood pressure, nor in ventilatory measurements, such as mean airway pressure, associated with the use of PCV.
 These results suggest that PCV may be a beneficial ventilatory modality in the treatment of severe respiratory failure since it results in improvement in arterial oxygenation, tissue oxygen delivery and utilization without any concomitant adverse effects on other hemodynamic or ventilatory factors.

"Lung function in school-age children who had mild lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood.
 We examined the relationship between patterns of mild lower respiratory illness (LRI) experienced in early childhood and lung function in 89 boys and 70 girls 6 to 18 yr of age.
 The children's histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI during the first 6 yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice.
 Most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the 2 yr prior to lung function testing.
 In sex-specific analyses, average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing LRI during the preschool years.
 Boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing LRI during the preschool years had lower average FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness.
 The association between recurrent preschool wheezing LRI and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the 2 yr prior to study.
 Girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing LRI had lower average FEF25-75 and Vmax50 than girls with a history of zero or one such illness, but differences were not statistically significant.
 Recurrent nonwheezing LRI during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex, regardless of preschool wheezing LRI history.
 Detailed information concerning early childhood LRI experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children.

"Comparison of expandable endotracheal stents in the treatment of surgically induced piglet tracheomalacia.
 Present surgical alternatives for pediatric tracheobronchomalacia are limited and associated with many potentially undesirable complications.
 The feasibility of different intraluminal expandable endotracheal stents for the treatment of surgically induced tracheomalacia was analyzed in 27 piglets.
 A potentially fatal tracheomalacia was surgically created.
 Either a stainless steel ""zig-zag"" stent or a woven polymeric stent was then implanted.
 Tracheal patency, mucosal function, histopathologic respiratory tract changes, and effects of the stent on esophageal motility were evaluated over a 16-week period.
 Piglets with steel stents uniformly experienced intense inflammation leading to tracheal dysfunction and death.
 Piglets with polymeric stents experienced minimal respiratory symptoms.
 Expandable polymeric endotracheal stents alleviate surgically induced piglet tracheomalacia, were easy to insert, allowed for tracheal growth, and reduced the need for high-risk surgical procedures with prolonged ventilatory support.

"Improved outcome at 28 days of age for very low birth weight infants treated with a single dose of a synthetic surfactant 
 Two identical double-blind, controlled, randomized trials were initiated to determine whether the administration of a single 5 ml/kg dose of a synthetic surfactant (Exosurf Neonatal), soon after the delivery of infants with birth weights 700 to 1350 gm, would improve rates of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 Both trials were terminated before enrolling their planned sample sizes because of the availability of Exosurf under the provisions of a Treatment Investigational New Drug program.
 We report the combined results of these trials.
 Study infants were stratified according to birth weight and gender before random assignment to a treatment regimen.
 One hundred ninety-two infants received Exosurf and 193 received an air placebo.
 The study groups were similar when a variety of demographic features describing the mothers, their pregnancies, the circumstances of the births, and the infants were compared.
 Exosurf-treated infants required significantly less oxygen and respiratory support during the first 3 days of life in comparison with the air-treated infants.
 Fewer infants in the Exosurf group had pulmonary interstitial emphysema (26 vs 13; p = 0.028).
 In the Exosurf group, there was a significant reduction in the combined outcome, neonatal death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (57 vs 39; p = 0.042), and there was a significant increase in rates of survival without this disease (128 vs 137; p = 0.042).
 There were no differences between treatment groups in the incidences of a variety of complications of prematurity, including apnea, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis.
 We conclude that improvements in respiratory physiology after a single prophylactic dose of Exosurf result in an increased likelihood of neonatal survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

"Pulmonary aspiration during emergency endoscopy in patients with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency and significance of aspiration and its clinical importance in patients with upper GI bleeding undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the ICU.
 DESIGN: Thirty consecutive patients with active and severe upper GI bleeding were studied.
 SETTING: ICU.
 PATIENTS: Ranged in age from 20 to 78 yr with an equal number of males and females.
 INTERVENTIONS: All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring and had chest radiographs obtained less than 12 hr before endoscopy and less than 4 hr after endoscopy.
 MEASUREMENTS: Six (20%) of 30 patients developed new lung infiltrates after esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
 In this group of patients, preendoscopy chest radiographs were obtained after less than 4 hr.
 In five of these patients, infiltrates were accompanied by fever and/or leukocytosis and oxygen desaturation to less than 90% during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
 CONCLUSION: Clinically significant aspiration pneumonia frequently complicates esophagogastroduodenoscopy in upper GI bleeding patients and is an important mechanism of esophagogastroduodenoscopy-induced hypoxia.

"Community-acquired pulmonary infections in a public municipal hospital in the 1980s.
 The relative and absolute incidences of community-acquired bacterial and tuberculous pulmonary infections, in patients admitted to a public municipal hospital, and the clinical and radiographic characteristics of these infections were retrospectively determined for the first time in 20 years.
 The data were compared to those previously reported in the literature.
 Such data were also specifically determined for alcoholics and compared to those found in nonalcoholics.
 The absolute numbers of infections due to pneumococci and anaerobes, and to tuberculosis, were not dissimilar to those reported in the literature, even though relatively few hemophilus infections were documented.
 The lack of Klebsiella sp infections was remarkable but not unexpected.
 Alcoholic patients had significantly higher rates of tuberculosis, cavitary disease, lung disease presumably due to anaerobes, and blood-culture-positive pneumonia.
 The relative concordance of our results for bacterial and tuberculous infections with those predicted from the published literature was striking.
 The high frequency of tuberculosis in our patients was particularly striking at a time when the incidence of tuberculosis nationwide, in patients without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has declined significantly.

"In vitro evaluation of bleomycin-induced cell lethality from plastic and glass containers.
 To optimize cancer chemotherapy, a considerable amount of research has been expended to study pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, biochemical, and pharmaceutic properties of antineoplastic agents.
 However, published data on the stability and compatibility of these agents in various administration fluids and containers are few in number.
 Evidence of a significant decrease in stability as shown by high-performance liquid chromatography has been reported when bleomycin was infused in plastic containers for prolonged periods (over 24 hours) as compared with the same procedure with glass containers.
 Because administration of bleomycin is usually given as a continuous infusion, we undertook this study to determine whether the drug loss of stability that occurs in plastic containers results in a therapeutic loss of efficacy (cytotoxicity).
 By using a tumor stem-cell assay we compared the quantitative effects of bleomycin in plastic and glass containers on cell lethality.
 The results from our assay showed no significant difference in cell lethality by bleomycin from its aqueous solution stored in glass and plastic containers over the time periods observed.
 If these results had been statistically significant, the tumor stem-cell assay may have been shown to be a more sensitive means of determining the clinical significance of these stability studies.

"MRI of the paranasal sinuses: incidental abnormalities and their relationship to symptoms.
 Magnetic resonance imaging is able to demonstrate a wide range of sinus abnormalities.
 Incidental findings in patients referred for neuroradiology because of suspected intracranial pathology are surprisingly common and were present in 37.5 per cent of 483 images examined.
 The maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were most commonly affected with 27 and 26 per cent of images abnormal whereas the frontal and sphenoid sinuses were less commonly affected with 5 per cent of each abnormal.
 If minor changes were excluded then 17 per cent of patients had either fluid, a polyp or marked mucosal thickening in at least one sinus.
 Nasal symptoms, other than the presence of a cold, showed no statistically significant relationship to abnormal findings.
 Many people with inflammatory changes in their sinuses demonstrated on MRI do not have symptoms classically attributed to sinusitis.

"External fixation using microplates after laryngotracheal expansion surgery. An animal study.
 Management of severe laryngotracheal stenosis requires treatment with open laryngeal surgical approaches.
 Performing the necessary anterior, and possibly posterior, incisions to expand the cricoid and tracheal rings causes instability of the segments.
 Placing an intraluminal stent has several disadvantages, ranging from injury of healthy tissue to airway obstruction.
 The availability of an external stent would avoid many of these complications.
 We performed expansion laryngeal surgery in dogs and explored the use of microplates for external fixation and determined the surgical outcome if no fixation is used.
 The results show that microplates are very effective in maintaining external fixation and that a need for placing an intraluminal stent when a posterior cricoid split is performed exists.

"The causes of hospital-treated acute lower respiratory tract infection in children.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic agents in children with acute lower respiratory infection.
 DESIGN: A survey of a series of patients.
 SETTING: General pediatric hospital serving an urban population with and without referrals in Helsinki, Finland.
 PARTICIPANTS: 135 Finnish children aged 2 months to 15 years (mean, 1.75 years), with clinically defined acute lower respiratory infection (with difficulty of breathing), or found to have fever and a pneumonic infiltrate on chest roentgenogram.
 SELECTION PROCEDURES: Consecutive sample on voluntary basis.
 INTERVENTIONS: None.
 MAIN RESULTS: Of 121 children with adequate samples, an etiologic diagnosis could be established in 84 (70%): 30 (25%) had bacterial, 30 (25%) viral, and 24 (20%) mixed infections.
 Antibody assays alone identified the agent in 91% of positive cases.
 CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections are common but generally underestimated in acute lower respiratory infection; serologic methods add significantly to their detection.

"Long-term enteral feeding of aged demented nursing home patients 
 The terminal phase of dementia is initiated by the inability to swallow.
 New techniques of enteral alimentation permit more effective, longer intubation.
 To assess the application of these new techniques to late-stage demented aged patients, all current intubations in a teaching nursing home were reviewed.
 Of 52 feeding intubations, 26 had been in situ for more than 1 year.
 A randomly selected comparison group of nonintubated patients was also studied.
 Weight increased for 48% of the intubated group versus 17% of the nonintubated group (P less than .01).
 Aspiration pneumonia occurred more often in the intubated group (58%) than in the nonintubated group (17%) (P less than .01).
 Decubitus ulcers were also more common in the intubated group (21%) than in the nonintubated group (14%).
 Restraints were used more in the intubated group (71%) than in the nonintubated group (56%).
 These differences did not reach statistical significance.
 All of the intubated patients were severely demented, with MMSE scores of zero.
 Seventy-one percent of the nonintubated group were demented, with MMSE scores of less than 23.
 Prolongation of the terminal phase of dementia in the aged by tube feeding is now feasible.
 The implications of this change in the life-span of demented nursing home patients need attention by families, nursing homes, and those who make public health policy.

 Dust samples were taken from living quarters of patients and hospital volunteers.
 The level of Df antigen in these living quarters was measured by RAST inhibition.
 All samples showed Df antigen within a large range of values.
 Prick tests were done to house dust mite and molds on 91 patients with suspected allergic disease with 63 (69%) reacting to at least one antigen.
 Of these, 56 (88.9%) reacted to one or both mites.

"Intermittent volume cycled mechanical ventilation via nasal mask in patients with respiratory failure due to COPD.
 Intermittent mechanical ventilation via nasal CPAP mask was provided to 13 patients admitted to this institution for exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure.
 Ten suffered from COPD, two suffered from obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and one from severe hypothyroidism.
 All except one presented with dyspnea and hypercapnia due solely to progression of their underlying disease processes.
 Six of the patients with COPD and the patient with hypothyroidism responded to positive pressure ventilation by mask with improvements in blood gas values and clinical status.
 The remaining two patients with COPD and the two patients with OHS were unable to use the system.
 Four of the patients with COPD and chronic respiratory failure have been subsequently maintained on daily volume ventilation via nasal mask for about 20 months with persistent clinical and physiologic improvements.
 Application of volume ventilation through the nasal CPAP mask is a feasible strategy for providing long-term mechanical ventilation to selected patients with COPD and respiratory failure.

"Hemoptysis. Indications for bronchoscopy.
 Indications for bronchoscopy in patients with hemoptysis and a normal or nonlocalizing chest roentgenogram continue to be controversial.
 We reviewed the records for 119 bronchoscopies performed for hemoptysis in patients with a normal (n = 75) or nonlocalizing (n = 44) chest roentgenogram.
 Bronchogenic carcinoma was identified in 2.5% of the bronchoscopies.
 Additional neoplasms were found in another 2.5%.
 The presence of nonlocalizing abnormalities was not associated with an increase in either the rate of bronchogenic carcinoma or in the diagnostic yield (specific anatomic diagnosis or bleeding site identified) at bronchoscopy when compared with patients with normal chest roentgenograms.
 The factors of male sex, age more than 40 years, and a more than 40 pack-year smoking history appear useful in identifying patients in whom the yield of bronchoscopy is likely to be high.

"Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis after cardiac transplantation.
 To evaluate the incidence and clinical features of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis after cardiac transplantation, we identified 27 (16%) of 171 consecutive recipients in whom CMV pneumonitis was confirmed by strict diagnostic criteria.
 Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis occurred in 6 (30%) of 20 patients treated with azathioprine and prednisone, and 8 (25%) of 32 patients treated with azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone, but only 13 (11%) of 119 patients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone.
 The incidence of CMV pneumonitis was not related to recipient preoperative CMV titers or to postoperative cardiac rejection, but there was a trend toward increased CMV pneumonitis in patients who received organs from CMV-positive donors.
 Mean onset of CMV pneumonitis was 2.9 +/- 1.6 (SD) months after transplantation.
 In the azathioprine-prednisone group, CMV was always associated with at least one other respiratory pathogen (Aspergillus, n = 5; Pneumocystis carinii, n = 2).
 In the two cyclosporine groups, CMV was either the sole respiratory pathogen (n = 9), or associated with P carinii (n = 11).
 Roentgenographically, diffuse bilateral hazy pulmonary opacities were present in 19 (70%) of 27 patients, but focal subsegmental opacity (26%), small pleural effusion (26%), and lobar consolidation (7%) were also observed.
 When bronchoscopy was performed, bronchoalveolar lavage was the most sensitive technique for detecting CMV (72%), whereas transbronchial biopsy (39%) and combined washings and brushings (33%) were relatively insensitive techniques.
 Respiratory failure and death occurred in 52% and 44%, respectively, of patients with CMV pneumonitis.
 In this population of immunocompromised hosts: (1) CMV pneumonitis, alone or with other respiratory pathogens, was a major cause of morbidity and mortality; (2) localized roentgenographic opacity did not exclude CMV pneumonitis; (3) bronchoalveolar lavage was the most sensitive bronchoscopic technique for detecting CMV pneumonitis.

"Interleukin-2 induces early multisystem organ edema mediated by neutrophils.
 Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an agent known to activate neutrophils (PMN) with thromboxane (Tx)B2 release, produces pulmonary edema within 6 hours of intravenous infusion.
 This study tests the role of PMN in mediating the edema.
 Anesthetized rats received 10(6)U recombinant human IL-2 (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 14) as a constant intravenous infusion during a period of 1 hour.
 At this time there was leukopenia 3.63 +/- 0.43 (x10(3)/mm3) relative to vehicle-infused control rats 6.12 +/- 0.86 and a decline in PMN, 2.19 +/- 0.14 relative to control value of 3.33 +/- 0.05 (both p less than 0.05).
 After 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in the wet to dry weight (W/d) ratio, was present in the lungs (4.93 +/- 0.20 relative to control 4.06 +/- 0.10), heart (4.09 +/- 0.11 versus 3.76 +/- 0.08), liver (3.50 +/- 0.10 versus 3.18 +/- 0.10), and kidney (4.25 +/- 0.07 versus 4.00 +/- 0.07) (all p less than 0.05).
 There was increased lung permeability demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to control 460 +/- 90 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05).
 Interleukin-2 resulted in lung PMN sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma TxB2 levels to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL relative to control 481 +/- 93 pg/mL (p less than 0.05).
 Pretreatment of other rats (n = 8) with selective anti-rat neutrophil antiserum 18 hours before the experiment led to a peripheral PMN count 10% of baseline and prevented edema in the lungs (W/d ratio 4.20 +/- 0.16) and heart (3.67 +/- 0.07) (both p less than 0.05) but not liver or kidney.
 Protein in lung lavage was reduced to 760 +/- 220 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05).
 The protection afforded by leukopenia was associated with lack of PMN sequestration and prevention of the increase in plasma Tx levels (484 +/- 120 pg/mL, p less than 0.05).
 These data indicate that the rapid induction of lung and heart edema with a 1-hour infusion of IL-2 in the rat is mediated, in large part, by activated PMNs.

"Adverse reactions to co-trimoxazole in HIV infection.
 The origin of the increased frequency of side-effects to co-trimoxazole in HIV-positive patients is unknown.
 Data on plasma concentrations of the parent compounds are inconclusive.
 Evidence points to the hydroxylamine derivatives of sulphamethoxazole as the reactive metabolites that cause adverse reactions to co-trimoxazole.
 HIV-positive individuals have a systemic glutathione deficiency, and therefore a reduced capacity to scavenge such metabolites.
 This process would lead to an increased exposure to toxic intermediates and would explain the high frequency of adverse reactions to co-trimoxazole in these patients.

"Blood eosinophilia and FEV1. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.
 A previous cross-sectional analysis of 1980 data from a population of working men in the Paris area has shown a significant relationship of blood eosinophilia to a reduced FEV1 among nonsmokers, remaining after excluding men with a history of asthma.
 In the present report, we reexamine this relationship, after taking into account asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and positive skin prick tests, using data collected in 1985 in a subsample of 363 men from the initial population.
 Blood eosinophilia, defined by 5% or more eosinophils or by 250 or more eosinophils per cubic millimeter appeared to be associated with a lower FEV1, primarily in nonsmokers.
 A difference of approximately 0.40 L was observed in never-smokers with eosinophilia (greater than or equal to 5% of eosinophils) compared with those without.
 This association persisted after exclusion of subjects with atopy, asthma, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
 Longitudinally, no significant association was observed between 1980 eosinophilia and the annual FEV1 decline between 1980 and 1985, even in nonsmokers.
 The results of our cross-sectional analyses suggest that asthma or asthma-like disorder does not explain the association between eosinophilia and FEV1.
 The role of eosinophil in respiratory disorders may go beyond its intervention in allergy.
 Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand discrepancies between cross-sectional and longitudinal data and whether eosinophilia is a risk factor for chronic air-flow limitation.

"Clinical symptoms in young adults with atypical chest pain attending the emergency department.
 Clinical symptoms were studied in 69 consecutive patients below the age of 40 years who were attending the emergency unit because of unexplained chest pain.
 In a structured interview a few weeks after the emergency visit, only one-third of the patients reported that they believed in the doctor's diagnosis; they believed in a psychological or cardiac origin of the pain more often than the doctors.
 The chest pain was most often described as oppressive and/or stabbing.
 In 95% of cases it was central or left-sided.
 Associated symptoms were commonly reported, breathlessness being most commonly reported by two-thirds of the patients, followed by dizziness, palpitation and numbness/tingling.
 Mental symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety and tension were frequently reported.
 On the basis of the background literature the aetiology is discussed.
 We conclude that immediate symptom analysis, including psychosomatic symptoms, particularly breathing problems, is of central importance.

"AIDS-associated polyclonal lymphoma: identification of a new HIV-associated disease process.
 High-grade non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma is one of the principle malignancies that occurs in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1).
 Immunoblastic lymphomas that arise in immunosuppressed transplant patients have been described as both monoclonal and polyclonal, and occur in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.
 To test whether polyclonal lymphoma occurred in patients with AIDS we studied tumors from multiple sites in three patients who died with widespread AIDS-associated large cell or large cell immunoblastic lymphoma.
 All biopsy specimens contained invasive lymphoma.
 Tumor cells were mature IgM-positive immunoblasts by immunohistochemical analysis, with the same B-cell phenotype observed in all tumor sites.
 Only a minority of sites from all patients analyzed were monoclonal as measured by immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, with one case having several foci of monoclonal disease with other histologically identical metastases showing no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
 Similar to the transplant-associated polyclonal B-cell proliferations.
 EBV gene sequences were present in multiple sites from one autopsy.
 In the other two autopsies, polyclonal B-cell proliferations occurred in the absence of EBV involvement except at one site, where a minor clone of EBV-infected cells was found.
 In contrast to HIV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma, no c-myc rearrangements were found at any site.
 These studies describe the occurrence of polyclonal lymphoma in AIDS and suggest that EBV-negative polyclonal lymphoma may be a distinct disease entity unique to HIV-infected individuals.

"Exposure-related declines in the lung function of cotton textile workers. Relationship to current workplace standards.
 To evaluate the effectiveness of the current workplace standards in preventing chronic health effects from cotton dust exposure, a 5-yr longitudinal study of a large multimill population of cotton textile and synthetic process workers, employed at a major U.S.
 textile company, was conducted.
 To control for and assess the effect of type of work area on annual change in lung function, we limited the analysis to those 1,817 subjects who, throughout their textile work history at the company, worked exclusively in cotton yarn manufacturing or slashing and weaving, or in synthetic textile mills.
 The expected effect of smoking on average annual change in lung function was demonstrated for both cotton and synthetic workers.
 Despite lower overall dust exposure, cotton yarn workers exhibited steeper annual declines in lung function than did workers in slashing and weaving; this difference persisted within each smoking category, indicating a dust potency effect.
 There were mill differences in annual change in lung function among cotton workers, potentially masking an exposure effect.
 A smoking-work area interaction persisted after adjusting for mill differences, with the largest annual declines observed in cotton yarn workers who smoke.
 A significant dose-response relationship was seen in cotton yarn manufacturing between annual declines in FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 and average exposure by mill, and the larger declines were found in mills using the highest percentage and lowest grade of cotton.
 Synthetic textile workers had larger declines than did cotton textile workers, which were not explained by smoking or duration of employment.
 Unrecognized and unmeasured causative exposures or selection bias could explain this result.

"Phase I and imaging trial of indium 111-labeled anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody 225 in patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma 
 Murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) 225 (IgG1) against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor competitively blocks EGF binding and inhibits EGF-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinase and cell proliferation.
 The effect of MAb 225 was studied in a phase I trial in patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which invariably expresses high levels of EGF receptors.
 Groups of three patients received total doses of MAb 225 ranging from 1 mg to 300 mg.
 Except at the lowest dose, each infusion included 4 mg of indium 111 (111In)-labeled MAb 225.
 No toxicity was observed.
 Tumors were imaged in all patients who received doses of 20 mg or greater.
 Presumed metastases greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter were imaged with doses of 40 mg or greater.
 Single-photon-emission-computed tomography could be carried out at the 120-mg and 300-mg doses and significantly improved tumor visualization.
 All patients produced anti-murine antibodies.
 We conclude that treatment with an MAb that inhibits EGF receptor function is safe at the doses and schedule studied.
 111In-labeled MAb images squamous cell lung carcinoma; tumor uptake of the labeled MAb is dose dependent.
 Further studies are warranted to explore the potential therapeutic efficacy of anti-EGF receptor MAbs and other agents that act in a comparable manner.

 Suction of the upper lobe bronchi could not be performed because of the combination of the peculiar anatomy of the upper lobe bronchi with catheter design.
 We treated successfully two cases of atelectasis of the right upper lobes using a Rusch Metras bronchography catheter with a guide mark which is not readily available.
 Therefore we devised a J-shape tipped catheter with a guide mark.
 We have successfully treated 13 episodes of atelectasis of the right upper lobe in 10 patients and one episode in the left upper lobe in one patient with this new catheter.

"Decision analysis, public health policy, and isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for young adult tuberculin skin reactors.
 As part of a plan to eliminate tuberculosis in America, tuberculin skin testing was advised for all US citizens, with isoniazid chemopreventive therapy administered to appropriate positive reactors.
 Implementation of this plan, however, may be limited by concerns over which skin test reactors should receive isoniazid therapy.
 Recent decision analyses suggest that, contrary to American Thoracic Society guidelines, asymptomatic skin test reactors under age 35 years with normal chest roentgenograms and no predisposing conditions to tuberculosis reactivation will not benefit from isoniazid chemopreventive therapy.
 Repeated analysis of these studies reveals that calculated life expectancy depends on estimates of the probability of certain chance outcomes.
 If the isoniazid-related hepatitis case-fatality rate is below 1%, isoniazid chemopreventive therapy appears to be beneficial.
 A literature review suggests that this rate is indeed this low.
 If the tuberculosis case-fatality rate is above 6.7%, also supported by the literature, the advantages of isoniazid therapy are further increased.
 This repeated analysis should reassure physicians that isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for tuberculin skin test reactors is beneficial to the individual and consonant with public health policies.

"The radiographic diagnosis of emphysema.
 There are many findings of emphysema by conventional radiography, but the most reliable and reproducible is that of overinflation, which is best judged by the height and contour of the hemidiaphragm.
 Even in expert hands, the diagnosis of emphysema by conventional radiography is 65% to 80% accurate, depending to a large degree on the clinical population studied.
 Although most patients with severe emphysema are diagnosed correctly, only half of those patients with mild-to-moderate levels of parenchymal destruction are detected.
 Emphysema is identified by CT as focal, unmarginated, hypodense areas unassociated with fibrosis.
 Emphysema also may be detected by computer programs selecting pixels with abnormally low attenuation values.
 By either method, CT is superior to chest radiography in detection of mild and moderate degrees of emphysema and has detection rates of more than 90% and correlation with extent and severity of disease in more than 80% of patients.
 CT may be more sensitive to the presence of mild emphysema than pulmonary function tests, which are global indications of lung function.
 HRCT appears to offer a small, but real, advantage over 10-mm collimation in identification of small areas of emphysema, but areas of emphysema smaller than 0.5 cm in diameter are commonly missed, even with HRCT.
 Wider use of CT for investigation of relatively asymptomatic smokers may allow early diagnosis of emphysema and provide more information of the natural history of this disease, information that is sorely lacking at this time.
 Assessment of potential therapy such as smoking cessation or antioxidants will only be possible with widespread use of a method that is of relatively low risk, easy to duplicate, and accurate.

"Follow-up of infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for newborn respiratory failure.
 Follow-up studies were conducted to assess the medical and developmental outcome of 92 infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at the University of Michigan.
 Of 118 near-term (greater than 34 weeks' gestation) infants who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 103 (87%) were surviving and available for follow-up at between 1 and 7 years of age.
 Ninety-two of these children were seen on at least one occasion.
 Each visit included a history and physical examination, an evaluation by a physical therapist, and developmental testing by a pediatric psychologist.
 Medical outcome during year 1 found 31% of the children rehospitalized, primarily with respiratory illness.
 Outpatient-treated lower respiratory tract illness was seen in an additional 31% of the children.
 New or nonstatic neurologic problems were noted in 6% of the children.
 Abnormal growth during year 1 occurred in 26% of the children.
 At last clinic visit 16% of the children exhibited moderate-to-severe neurologic abnormalities, and 8% had moderate-to-severe cognitive delay.
 Sensorineural hearing loss occurred in 4% of children.
 Nine percent of the children were receiving speech and language therapy; screening tests showed that an additional 6% had speech and language delay.
 Overall, at last visit 16 (20%) of the children exhibited some type of handicap.
 A review of the literature on follow-up studies of non-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-treated infants with persistent pulmonary artery hypertension produced an impairment rate of 18.5%.
 Outcome post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation appears similar to that seen in less ill cohorts of infants treated with more ""conventional"" therapy.
 Long-term follow-up of all such infants remains essential.

"Serum adenosine deaminase in viral and bacterial pneumonia.
 We measured the activity of serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) in paired sera from 171 military conscripts with radiographically verified pneumonia.
 Patient serum samples were selected on the basis of serologic analyses identifying as single etiologic agents Streptococcus pneumoniae in 29 patients, Haemophilus influenzae in 7, Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 43, adenovirus in 24, influenza A or B in 12, and parainfluenza in 5 patients.
 In 14 patients Neisseria meningitidis and in 31 Chlamydia spp were considered the main etiologic agent.
 Compared with a control group of 45 healthy men, the ADA activity in patients with pneumonia was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in all patient groups except those with meningococcal pneumonia.
 The highest ADA levels were seen in patients with pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae (27.4 +/- 9.7 U/L), Chlamydia spp (26.3 +/- 9.1 U/L), and adenovirus (28.5 +/- 10.9 U/L) compared with the controls (11.1 +/- 3.0 U/L).
 In patients with meningococcal pneumonia, the ADA activity was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001).
 Serum ADA activity probably reflects differences in cellular immune response to different infectious agents.
 The ADA determinations may give corroborative information on the etiologic agent of pneumonia.

"Improved tumor imaging with radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies by plasma clearance of unbound antibody with anti-antibody column.
 Imaging of tumors by using radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAs) is hindered by the presence of background activity.
 To reduce this problem, the authors investigated the process of removing labeled MoAs from plasma at selected times by means of extracorporeal immunoadsorption.
 In seven patients with either lung or breast carcinoma, an indium-111-labeled murine antibody was intravenously administered.
 Six to 24 hours later, immunoadsorption was performed by passing the patients' plasma through a goat anti-mouse antibody column connected to a plasma separator.
 Whole-body computer images were obtained before and after the treatment.
 Blood pool activity in the images was reduced by an average of 59%, while tumor activity dropped by only 10%.
 Tumor-to-blood activity ratios therefore more than doubled, improving by an average of 121% between the pre- and posttreatment image sets.
 Eight of 12 areas of known disease and three areas of unknown but later documented disease were detected after the immunoadsorption process, while the three areas of unknown disease and three of the areas of known disease were not detected in the preclearance images.
 Thus, the feasibility of using extracorporeal immunoadsorption to improve MoA imaging of tumors was demonstrated.

"Increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness after inhaling salbutamol during 1 year is not caused by subsensitization to salbutamol.
 Recently, it was suggested that long-term administration of an inhaled beta 2-agonist might increase bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to histamine, possibly as a consequence of subsensitization to the inhaled beta 2-agonist.
 To test this hypothesis, we studied two groups of patients with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 An experimental group of 15 patients, inhaling 400 micrograms of salbutamol four times daily during 1 year and subsequently 40 micrograms of ipratropium bromide four times daily for 6 months, and a control group, consisting of 22 patients with the opposite treatment regimen.
 The BHR, the response in FEV1 to cumulative doses of salbutamol, and the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors and antagonist affinity of these receptors on circulating lymphocytes were assessed at the start of the study and at 6-month intervals for 1 1/2 years.
 The BHR increased significantly (p = 0.001) during the year salbutamol was inhaled and returned to about the value at the start of the study after inhaling ipratropium bromide for 6 months.
 No change occurred in the bronchodilating responses to cumulative doses of salbutamol, nor was any change observed in the number and the affinity of beta 2-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes.
 It was concluded that long-term use of salbutamol caused a small but significant increase in BHR.
 The increase in BHR was not caused by subsensitization of beta 2-adrenoceptors to salbutamol.

"Respi-Care. An innovative home care program for the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a hospital-based home care program for a group of patients with severe COPD.
 Respi-Care was a multidisciplinary home care program administered by Norwalk Hospital in cooperation with the public health nursing departments of the city of Norwalk and the town of Wilton, Conn.
 The overall goal of Respi-Care was to provide more comprehensive home care services to patients previously requiring frequent hospitalizations by combining the advantages of hospital resources and community agencies through a unique cooperative effort.
 Preprogram and on-program data were collected on the following variables for the 48 months of Respi-Care operation: hospitalizations; hospital days; emergency room visits; home care services; and the costs of these services.
 Costs of operating the Respi-Care program were included in on-program data.
 Seventeen subjects completed 320.5 months on Respi-Care.
 Each subject was matched to an equal length of time prior to entering the program, for a total of 641 months analyzed.
 There were 88 preprogram hospitalizations for the group; hospitalizations while participating in Respi-Care dropped to 53 (p = 0.022; paired t statistics).
 On-program hospital days showed a significant decrease, from 1,181 preprogram days to 667 on-program days (p = 0.024).
 Emergency room visits decreased from 105 before the program to 64 during the program (p = 0.017).
 Costs of care also decreased.
 Costs for hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and home care fell from $908,031 to $802,999, resulting in a $105,032 savings or $328 per patient per month.

"Decreased mortality rate among small premature infants treated at birth with a single dose of synthetic surfactant: a multicenter controlled trial. American Exosurf Pediatric Study Group 1.
 To determine whether a single prophylactic dose of synthetic surfactant would reduce mortality and morbidity rates, we performed a randomized, controlled trial of Exosurf Neonatal at 19 hospitals in the United States.
 The Exosurf preparation (5 ml/kg) was instilled into the endotracheal tube of premature infants weighing 700 to 1100 gm during mechanical ventilation, as soon as practical after birth.
 Control infants were treated with air (5 ml/kg).
 Dose administration was performed in secrecy by clinicians who did not reveal for 2 years what they had instilled.
 A total of 222 infants received air and 224 received the synthetic surfactant; 36 infants with congenital pneumonia or malformations were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis.
 By the age of 28 days, there were 44 deaths in the air group and 27 deaths in the surfactant group (p = 0.022).
 By the age of 1 year after term there were 61 deaths in the air group and 35 deaths in the surfactant group (p = 0.002).
 Although there was no reduction in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome, a significant reduction in the number of deaths attributed to respiratory distress syndrome, a significant reduction in the incidence of pulmonary air leaks, and significantly lower requirements for oxygen and mean airway pressure indicated that lung disease was less severe in the Exosurf-treated infants.
 There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and infection.
 The results indicate that a single prophylactic dose of Exosurf, in high-risk premature infants treated soon after birth, reduces the number of deaths from respiratory distress syndrome and the overall mortality rate.

"Intermediate alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency with apical lung bullae and spontaneous pneumothorax. Presence of a Z variant in an American black.
 A 43-year-old black man had an 18-year history of apical lung cystic-bullous disease.
 Following two episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax and two instances of thoracotomy for bullectomy and pleural abrasion, he was found to have an intermediate AAT deficiency with an MZ phenotype.
 It is believed that this is the first case of localized bullous lung disease to be reported in association with any degree of AAT deficiency.
 There is evidence that the cystic lesions progressed to form upper lobe bullae.
 It is postulated that the AAT deficiency may have played a role in this progression, as did the patient's cigarette smoking.
 Following two instances of surgery, CT scans of the lungs, compliance studies and complete pulmonary function tests show no further evidence of lung bullae or emphysema.

"Variation of initial serum bilirubin rise in newborn infants with type of illness.
 Hyperbilirubinaemia in newborn infants is generally regarded as a problem, and bilirubin itself as toxic metabolic waste, but the high frequency in newborn infants suggests that the excess of neonatal bilirubin may have a positive function.
 To investigate the hypothesis that bilirubin has a role as a free-radical scavenger, the rate of rise in serum bilirubin in the first few days of life was measured in 44 infants with five illnesses thought to enhance free-radical production and in 58 control infants.
 The infants were selected from 2700 consecutive births by exclusion of those with factors known to affect bilirubin metabolism, including enteral feeding.
 The control infants were those who seemed to be ill and received treatment, including restriction of enteral feeds, but in whom no illness, or disorders not related to free-radical production, were found.
 The mean serum bilirubin rise was significantly lower in the combined illness group than in the control group (36.1 [95% Cl 26.9-45.3] vs 66.7 [55.9-77.5] mumol.l-1.day-1; p less than 0.0001).
 In subgroup analyses the mean rises in infants with circulatory failure, neonatal depression/asphyxia, aspiration syndromes, and proven sepsis were significantly lower than in controls matched for gestational age and birthweight, but rises in infants with respiratory distress and their matched controls did not differ.
 These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bilirubin is consumed in vivo as an antioxidant.
 Such consumption may operate in vivo in addition to the standard pathways for bilirubin metabolism (production, isomerisation, and excretion).

"Oral almitrine in treatment of acute respiratory failure and cor pulmonale in patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease.
 The effects of oral almitrine bismesylate, a respiratory stimulant that acts on peripheral arterial chemoreceptors, was studied in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and hypoxaemic cor pulmonale.
 Twenty three patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of ventilatory failure were randomised to receive either almitrine 100 mg twice a day reducing to 50 mg twice a day over 48 hours or placebo in addition to conventional treatment.
 On admission the mean (SE) values for blood gas tensions were PaO2 4.8 (0.3) and PaCO2 7.7 (0.3) kPa in the 12 patients who received almitrine and PaO2 4.9 (0.1) and PaCO2 7.6 (0.3) kPa in the 11 who received placebo.
 After three hours of oxygen therapy at 1 1/min there was a similar rise in PaO2 in both groups, 6.4 (0.2) kPa in those receiving almitrine and 6.6 (0.4) kPa in those receiving placebo.
 After 24 hours of oxygen therapy values of PaO2 were again similar at 6.3 (0.8) kPa and 6.7 (2.2) kPa respectively.
 Arterial blood gas tensions improved during the study in those who survived but no significant differences were apparent between the two groups.
 There were six deaths, five in the almitrine group and one in the placebo group.
 There were no differences between the groups in respiratory rate, results of spirometry, oxygen requirement, or degree of dyspnoea (on visual analogue scale).
 The results did not show any benefit from oral almitrine in patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to chronic obstructive airways disease.
 Plasma almitrine concentrations, however, were often below the optimum therapeutic range, suggesting impaired drug absorption.

 Our purpose was to characterize the tachykinin receptor type involved in nasal obstruction to exogenous substance P in rhinitic patients.
 We also attempted to assess biochemical and cellular events associated with this response.
 Nasal challenges were performed in seven patients with allergic rhinitis.
 They received increasing doses (10 to 80 nmol) of substance P, of neurokinin A, of the N-terminal fragment of substance P, substance P(1-9), and of saline on 4 different days separated by 14 days.
 Nasal airway resistance (NAR) increased in a dose-dependent manner on substance P.
 Maximal increase reached 4.5-fold basal NAR.
 Response to neurokinin A was significantly lower (less than 2-fold basal NAR).
 No effect was observed on substance P(1-9) and saline.
 This order of activity [substance P much greater than neurokinin A greater than substance P(1-9) = saline] indicates an NK1 receptor-mediated mechanism inducing local vasodilation.
 No histamine release was found after any of the four challenges.
 Proteins significantly increased in nasal lavage fluid on both substance P and neurokinin A, whereas substance P(1-9) and saline had no effect.

"A randomized trial of a single bolus dosage regimen of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.
 Experiments in animals have demonstrated that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated, and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short period.
 In previous studies in patients with thrombotic disease, rt-PA has been shown to be an effective thrombolytic agent when administered by continuous infusion over a period between 90 minutes and 8 hours.
 To determine whether a short course regimen of rt-PA can achieve thrombolysis, a double-blind randomized trial has been conducted in which patients with objectively established acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism who were receiving heparin were allocated to either a 2-minute infusion of rt-PA at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg (33 patients) or saline placebo (25 patients).
 Perfusion lung scanning was used to assess the change in pulmonary perfusion at 24 hours and seven days post-study drug administration.
 Thirty-four percent of the rt-PA patients had a greater than 50 percent resolution in the perfusion defect at 24 hours compared to 12 percent of placebo patients (p = 0.026).
 At 24 hours, the mean relative improvement in the perfusion defect was 37.0 percent in rt-PA treated patients compared to 18.8 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.017).
 By day 7, no difference in lung scan resolution was detected between the groups.
 There were no major bleeds in either group nor were there any differences in transfusion requirements between groups.
 Minor bleeding occurred in 15 of the rt-PA patients mainly at angiogram-catheter insertion and venipuncture sites.
 These results suggest that a bolus regimen of rt-PA produces accelerated thrombolysis and provides an alternative and convenient approach to thrombolytic therapy in patients with pulmonary embolism.

"Spirometric findings and mortality in never-smokers.
 The relation of ventilatory function to overall mortality has been studied in 662 male and 2048 female never-smokers who during the period 1976-1978 participated in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, a prospective community study of more than 14,000 men and women randomly selected from the general population of the City of Copenhagen.
 Until the end of 1986, 195 subjects who said they were never-smokers died.
 Mortality was analyzed using the proportional hazards model of Cox.
 In addition to measures of ventilatory function, the mortality analysis included age, sex, body-mass index, alcohol consumption, school education, diabetes mellitus, heart disease and bronchial asthma as confounding factors.
 Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) as a percentage of that predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) as a percentage of that predicted and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC were significant risk factors for mortality among both sexes.
 The relative risk of death associated with a 50% decrease in FEV1 and FVC as a percentage of a predicted value was 1.65 and 1.81, respectively.
 This study confirms that lowered ventilatory function is a strong risk factor for mortality among never-smokers of both sexes.

"Percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters: comparison of sonographically guided and blind techniques.
 We studied the value of sonographically guided puncture of the subclavian vein for placement of indwelling right atrial and permanent subcutaneously tunneled catheters (Hickman) for long-term venous access.
 The commonly used blind puncture is associated with complications such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, and hemothorax.
 The results and complications of 40 sonographically guided punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations of the subclavian vein (group 1, 31 patients) performed in the radiology department were compared with those of 40 blind percutaneous punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations (group 2, 29 patients) performed in the operating room.
 The patients were selected consecutively.
 The groups were comparable in age, sex, and indication for catheter placement; administration of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies was the major indication (group 1, 84%; group 2, 83%).
 All punctures in group 1 were successful; group 2 had two failures (5%).
 Puncture-related complications occurred significantly more in group 2 (10%) than in group 1 (0%) (p less than .05).
 These complications were pneumothorax in three cases and hemothorax in one.
 Complications not related to the puncture technique were prolonged bleeding at the entrance site (groups 1 and 2, two cases each), local infection (group 1, one case), thrombosis (group 1, three cases; group 2, two), catheter sepsis (group 1, 10 cases; group 2, 14), catheter occlusion (group 2, three cases), and catheter migration (groups 1 and 2, two cases each).

"Endotoxin requirements for alveolar macrophage stimulation.
 Acute pulmonary failure or ARDS in severely injured patients continues to be a significant problem.
 The most important clinical risk factor identified is sepsis syndrome.
 Sepsis syndrome is the clinical correlate of a malignant systemic inflammatory process and is directed in large part by the tissue-fixed macrophage (M phi), such as the alveolar M phi.
 The M phi is capable of producing most of the central inflammatory mediators responsible for the pathophysiology seen during sepsis and organ injury.
 Two major mediators are procoagulant activity (PCA), leading to diffuse microvascular thrombosis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), causing much of the physiologic derangement of sepsis.
 Endotoxins (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacterial cell walls are the primary inflammatory stimulus for the tissue-fixed M phi production of inflammatory mediators.
 It is not completely known how LPS interacts with its various cellular targets, but it is hoped that knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in stimulation of the M phi by endotoxin will lead to therapies to modulate the response and prevent deleterious processes such as ARDS.
 In the present studies, LPS from E.
 coli 0111:B4 was shown in a dose response to stimulate large levels of both PCA and TNF in alveolar M phi.
 LPS from Bacteroides fragilis and Lipid X (the monosaccharide precursor of endotoxin) were unable to cause stimulation of the M phi in vitro.
 However, both moieties, B.
 fragilis LPS and Lipid X, were able to effectively and specifically compete with E.

 Oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone are standard treatment for some neoplasms and necrotizing systemic vasculitis and are advocated with increasing frequency for idiopathic interstitial lung disease.
 During a 15-month period, we observed four cases of acute respiratory failure from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients treated with oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone.
 One patient each had polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with red blood cell aplasia.

 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell differentials and T-lymphocyte subpopulations were analysed in 95 HIV-infected patients with pulmonary symptoms to determine whether the type of cellular inflammatory response could be useful in diagnosis or as a prognostic marker.
 Patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) had more BAL fluid lymphocytes, mainly comprising CD8+ cells, and patients with bacterial infection had more neutrophils than other patients.
 Neither of these changes were mirrored in peripheral blood.
 Seven patients who died after their acute episode of PCP had significantly higher BAL fluid neutrophils than 53 patients with PCP who survived (P = 0.002).

"Rupture of a benign mediastinal teratoma into the right pleural cavity.
 A 27-year-old woman with a ruptured mediastinal cystic teratoma had high levels of amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen in cystic fluid.
 The activity of the amylase is thought to be the most likely cause of the rupture.
 High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural fluid are not necessarily indicative of a malignant lesion but may suggest the presence of a ruptured teratoma in patients with mediastinal tumors.

"Hut lung: a domestically acquired pneumoconiosis of mixed aetiology in rural women [published erratum appears in Thorax 1991 Jul;46(7):544]
 A form of pneumoconiosis in rural African women termed ""Transkei silicosis"" has been thought to be due to silica particles inhaled while they are hand grinding maize between rocks.
 Twenty five women were studied who were considered to have this condition according to the following criteria: rural domicile, radiographic and lung biopsy evidence of pneumoconiosis, no exposure to mining or industry and no evidence of active tuberculosis.
 They were assessed for radiological, pathological, physiological and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid features.
 Potential aetiological factors were assessed by determining levels of exposure to respirable quartz and non-quartz containing dusts and smoke in rural dwellings during maize grinding and cooking.
 Most of the women were symptomless.
 Radiological findings ranged from a miliary pattern to extensive fibrosis resembling progressive massive fibrosis.
 Histological features included simple ""anthracosis"" in 12, anthracosis with macules in six, and mixed dust fibrosis in seven.
 Cell numbers and their proportions in lavage fluid were normal.
 More than 60% of macrophages were heavily laden with inorganic inclusions.
 Respirable quartz concentrations and calculated cumulative time weighted exposures were below those recommended for industry during grinding with sandstone (100% quartz) and they were even lower during grinding with dolerite containing no quartz despite the presence of an appreciable amount of quartz in the ground maize.
 Total respirable dust and smoke concentrations were greater than the recommended safe levels.
 Three women had no exposure to maize grinding.
 It is concluded that the inhalation of non-quartz containing dust and smoke from biomass fuelled fires is more important in the aetiology of this condition than exposure to quartz dust.
 The term ""hut lung"" may be more appropriate.

"Maximum intensity exercise training in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 We studied high intensity, symptom-limited, endurance exercise training in 52 patients with COPD participating in a pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 The patients had moderate to severe airway obstruction and reduced exercise tolerance with ventilatory limitation.
 The target workload for endurance exercise testing was 95 percent of the baseline maximum treadmill work load.
 At training weeks 1, 4 and 8, they were training at 85, 84, and 86 percent respectively, of baseline maximum.
 After rehabilitation, there was an increase in maximal treadmill work load, VO2max, and endurance exercise time, and a decrease in perceived symptoms.
 Patients who did not reach anaerobic threshold (group 2) were able to train at a higher percentage of maximum exercise tolerance than patients who reached anaerobic threshold (group 1).
 The increase in exercise performance of both groups, however, was similar.
 We conclude that patients with moderate to severe COPD can perform exercise training successfully at intensity targets which represent higher percentages of maximum than typically recommended in normal individuals or other patients.

"Thrombolytic therapy for noncoronary diseases.
 Thrombolytic therapy has been used fairly extensively in the management of acute proximal deep-vein thrombophlebitis of the extremities, acute pulmonary embolism, and acute peripheral arterial thrombosis and embolism in addition to acute thrombotic coronary events.
 In the presence of acceptable indications and a favorable benefit to risk ratio, this form of therapy, when successful, has served as a useful adjunct in the management of these disorders.
 In deep-vein thrombophlebitis, lysis of the thrombus before permanent pathological changes (eg, organization, scarring) have occurred can prevent venous valvular dysfunction and postural venous hypertension and its complications, especially the postphlebitic syndrome.
 In the more severe forms of acute pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy, when applied early after symptom onset, decreases morbidity and is likely to prevent a chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and persistent pulmonary hypertension.
 In peripheral arterial thrombo-occlusive events, early restoration of flow through thrombolysis has been shown to limit ischemic damage and serve as a useful supplement to angioplasty or surgery.
 Thrombolytic therapy has been used less extensively in acute strokes.
 Here the danger of reperfusion causing bleeding into a softened area of brain undergoing infarction has slowed its evaluation for this disorder; its application to stroke remains experimental.

"Incentive spirometry versus routine chest physiotherapy for prevention of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery 
 We entered 876 patients into a clinical trial aimed at preventing pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery.
 Patients either received conventional chest physiotherapy or were encouraged to perform maximal inspiratory manoeuvres for 5 min during each hour while awake, using an incentive spirometer.
 The incidence of pulmonary complications did not differ significantly between the groups: incentive spirometry 68 of 431 (15.8%, 95% CI 14.0-17.6%), and chest physiotherapy 68 of 445 (15.3%, CI 13.6-17.0%).
 Nor was there a difference between the groups in the incidence of positive clinical signs, pyrexia, abnormal chest radiographs, pathogens in sputum, respiratory failure (PO2 less than 60 mm Hg), or length of stay in hospital.
 We conclude that prophylactic incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy are of equivalent clinical efficacy in the general management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

"Perioperative effect of methylprednisolone given during lung surgery on plasma concentrations of C3a and C5a.
 Methylprednisolone or saline (placebo) solution was infused intravenously in 28 patients undergoing elective lobectomy for lung cancer.
 The state of the complement system during and after surgery and the effects of methylprednisolone on biologically active products of complement were studied by measurements of plasma C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins and leukocyte counts in peripheral blood perioperatively.
 In the placebo group plasma concentrations of C3a were significantly increased on postoperative days 1 and 2, whereas C5a had risen significantly 6 hours after surgery and on days 1 and 2.
 Methylprednisolone infusion during surgery eliminated the postoperative elevation of C3a and C5a.
 The postoperative leukocyte count in peripheral blood was higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the controls.
 The observations indicated that methylprednisolone may reduce the influx of leukocytes from peripheral blood into the airways by attenuating production of biologically active complements.

"Can nurses perform surgical cricothyrotomy with acceptable success and complication rates?
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether flight nurses can perform surgical cricothyrotomies with acceptable success and complication rates.
 METHODS: This case series examined the survival, success, and complication rates of surgical cricothyrotomy.
 A specially trained flight nurse retrospectively reviewed all prehospital, emergency department, inpatient, autopsy, and outpatient follow-up records.
 RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients in whom surgical cricothyrotomy was attempted by a flight nurse during a two-and-one-half-year period were studied.
 Patients ranged in age from 9 to 76 years.
 The airway was not cannulated successfully by a flight nurse in two patients.
 In two patients, the tube was not in the cricothyroid space (one in the upper tracheal rings, and the other in the larynx).
 In three patients, packing was insufficient to stop bleeding from around the operative site; and in three the tube became occluded by blood in the emergency department.
 Finally, two patients developed subglottic stenosis.
 CONCLUSION: Surgical cricothyrotomy in the field can be performed reliably by specially trained nurses.
 Because only the most critically ill or injured patients with unmanageable airways are subjected to this procedure, a significant complication rate can be anticipated.

"Alveolar macrophage activation in experimental legionellosis.
 Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular parasite of alveolar macrophages.
 In vitro studies have shown that lymphokine-activated mononuclear phagocytes inhibit intracellular replication of L.
 pneumophila.
 To determine if recovery from legionellosis is associated with activation of alveolar macrophages in vivo to resist L.
 pneumophila, we studied an animal model of Legionnaires' disease.
 Rats were exposed to aerosolized L.
 pneumophila and alveolar macrophages were harvested during the recovery phase of infection.
 We compared these alveolar exudate macrophages with normal resident alveolar macrophages for the capacity to support or inhibit the intracellular growth of L.
 pneumophila.
 We also measured Ia expression as a marker of immunologic activation, and studied binding of bacteria, superoxide release, and the expression of transferrin receptors as potential mechanisms of resistance to L.
 pneumophila.
 For perspective on the specificity of these responses, we also studied alveolar exudate cells elicited by inhalation of heat-killed L.
 pneumophila, live Listeria monocytogenes, and live Escherichia coli.
 We found that alveolar exudate macrophages elicited by live L.
 pneumophila, but not heat-killed L.
 pneumophila, resisted the intracellular growth of L.
 pneumophila.
 Exudate macrophages in resolving legionellosis exhibited increased Ia expression, diminished superoxide production, and downregulation of transferrin receptors.
 Binding of L.
 pneumophila to exudate macrophages was indistinguishable from that to resident macrophages in the presence of normal serum, and augmented in the presence of immune serum.
 Alveolar exudate macrophages elicited by E.
 coli also inhibited growth of L.
 pneumophila, and exhibited a modest increase in Ia expression without change in transferrin receptors.
 Exudate cells induced by L.
 monocytogenes exhibited up-regulation of Ia without diminution of superoxide release.
 Alveolar cells harvested after inhalation of heat-killed L.
 pneumophila did not differ from resident alveolar macrophages in the expression of surface markers.
 These findings suggest that alveolar macrophages are immunologically activated in vivo to serve as effector cells in resolving legionellosis, and that live bacteria are required to induce this expression of immunity.
 The mechanism of resistance to parasitism by L.
 pneumophila may entail restriction of the intracellular availability of iron, but does not involve diminished bacterial binding or an augmented respiratory burst.

"Evaluation of serum CA 125 as a tumor marker in non-small cell lung cancer.
 Serum CA 125 levels were evaluated in 130 healthy subjects and 133 patients with untreated pulmonary lesions.
 These were 33 patients with benign pulmonary conditions and 100 with lung cancer.
 The mean concentration of CA 125 was higher in patients with lung cancer (37 +/- 81 U/ml) than in those with nonmalignant disease (4.2 +/- 5.7 U/ml) (P less than 0.01).
 In the healthy control group CA 125 concentrations were significantly lower (0.63 +/- 1.5 U/ml) (P less than 0.001).
 In patients with lung cancer the concentration of this tumor marker was related to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage.
 At a cut-off value of 15 U/ml, CA 125 had a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 65% with respect to healthy subjects; in patients with benign pulmonary conditions, these values were 44%, 94%, 94%, and 31%, respectively.
 At this cut-off value, a correlation between the respectability prognosis and the likelihood of survival 24 months posttreatment was observed.
 These findings suggest that CA 125 can be used as an adjunctive test in the management of patients with lung cancer patients.

"Gentamicin pharmacokinetics in neonates undergoing extracorporal membrane oxygenation.
 We evaluated the effects of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin in 18 infants who underwent ECMO therapy for severe respiratory failure and received gentamicin for possible sepsis.
 Twelve of these infants continued to receive gentamicin after ECMO had been discontinued.
 The volume of distribution (Vd) of gentamicin in the newborns receiving ECMO was 0.58 +/- 0.04 liter/kg, compared with a Vd of 0.45 +/- 0.02 liter/kg after ECMO had been discontinued (P = 0.02).
 The clearance of gentamicin in the patients undergoing ECMO was 42 +/- 3 ml/kg/hour compared with 57 +/- 4 ml/kg/hour in those patients off ECMO (P = 0.003).
 The elimination half-life in patients receiving ECMO was 10.0 +/- 0.7 hours compared with 5.7 +/- 0.4 hours after ECMO had been discontinued (P less than 0.0001).
 Neonates undergoing ECMO demonstrate a higher volume of distribution of gentamicin, a lower clearance, and consequently a longer half life for this drug.
 We conclude that gentamicin and probably other aminoglycosides should be given at dose rates about 25% lower than usual and at longer dosing intervals in patients undergoing ECMO therapy.

"Selective differences in macrophage populations and monokine production in resolving pulmonary granuloma and fibrosis.
 Alveolar macrophages (AM) and their production of interleukin-1-like activity (IL-1) and macrophage-derived growth factor for fibroblasts (MDGF) were examined during chronic inflammatory reactions leading to either granuloma formation or fibrosis.
 Groups of five rats each received, respectively, a single transtracheal injection of xonotlite, attapulgite, short chrysotile 4T30, UICC chrysotile B asbestos, or saline.
 One month later, such treatments induced either no change (xonotlite), granuloma formation (attapulgite and short chrysotile 4T30), or fibrosis (UICC chrysotile B).
 By 8 months, however, the granulomatous reactions had resolved or greatly diminished, whereas the fibrosis persisted irreversibly.
 Parallel examination of cell populations obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage revealed that multinucleated giant macrophages (MGC) were present in lavage fluids of animals with resolving granulomatous reactions but absent in those obtained from animals with lung fibrosis.
 Evaluation of monokine production by inflammatory macrophages also revealed significant differences.
 Enhanced production of IL-1-like activity was seen in both types of lung injury, although especially during the early stage (1 month) and decreased thereafter (8 months).
 By contrast, augmentation of MDGF production was observed in animals with lung fibrosis only and persisted up to 9 months.
 Taken together, these data indicate that production of selected cytokines, as well as AM differentiation along a given pathway, may modulate the outcome of a chronic inflammatory response.

"Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 In a group of 236 very low birth weight (VLBW) surviving infants, 60 had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the nursery.
 When compared with the 176 infants without BPD, infants with BPD were smaller, more immature, with lower one- and five-minute Apgar scores.
 Infants with BPD had a greater incidence of cardio-pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) complications in the nursery.
 On follow-up, 25 (42%) of these infants were abnormal developmentally compared to 7% of infants without BPD (p less than .001).
 When comparisons were made within the group of infants with BPD, very few differences were found in maternal or infant risk factors between the normal and abnormal infants.
 The infants with BPD who had poor outcome more often had seizures and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
 The infants with BPD who had good outcome were more often small for gestational age (SGA) and resuscitated with intubation at birth.
 They had apnea in the nursery more frequently than did abnormal infants with BPD.
 We conclude that VLBW infants with BPD are at greater risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome than those without BPD.
 The risk for the infant with BPD relates to CNS complications rather than to chronic lung disease.

"Positive and negative regulation of proliferation and differentiation in tracheobronchial epithelial cells.
 The lung (in particular the bronchial epithelium) is a major site for tumor formation in humans.
 Environmental factors in conjunction with genetic factors are important determinants in this disease.
 The acquisition of defects in the control of proliferation and differentiation appears to constitute crucial steps in the transition of a normal to a neoplastic cell.
 Several factors have been identified that control positively or negatively the proliferation and differentiation of tracheobronchial epithelial cells.
 These factors include EGF/TGF alpha, TGF beta, insulin/IGFI, KGF, certain cytokines, retinoids, and activators of protein kinase C.
 Studies with neoplastic cells have identified several protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes whose gene products are involved in the regulation of cell growth of normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and when mutated, lost, or activated, bring about a neoplastic phenotype.
 Future studies on the precise function of these genes will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which proliferation and differentiation in normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells are regulated and help to understand the molecular changes involved in diseases such as cancer.

 The histologic changes were minor in 10 of 20 patients, as shown by an increase in cell size; they were major in 10 of 20 patients, with the appearance of mixed composite tumors in which neuroendocrine (NE), epidermoid, and glandular components were mixed.
 Major changes correlated with a good response to chemotherapy (P = .001).
 Ultrastructural studies showed an increase in neurosecretory granules and desmosomes, and a high frequency of multidirectional differentiation (45%) when comparison was made with pretherapy samples (10%) (P less than .01).

"The otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): a clinical investigation of 225 patients using ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring and an experimental investigation of the role of acid and pepsin in the development of laryngeal injury.
 Occult (silent) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GER, GERD) is believed to be an important etiologic factor in the development of many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders of the upper aerodigestive tract.
 In order ot test this hypothesis, a human study and an animal study were performed.
 The human study consisted primarily of applying a new diagnostic technique (double-probe pH monitoring) to a population of otolaryngology patients with GERD to determine the incidence of overt and occult GERD.
 The animal study consisted of experiments to evaluate the potential damaging effects of intermittent GER on the larynx.
 Two hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with otolaryngologic disorders having suspected GERD evaluated from 1985 through 1988 are reported.
 Ambulatory 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring was performed in 197; of those, 81% underwent double-probe pH monitoring, with the second pH probe being placed in the hypopharynx at the laryngeal inlet.
 Seventy percent of the patients also underwent barium esophagography with videofluoroscopy.
 The patient population was divided into seven diagnostic subgroups: carcinoma of the larynx (n = 31), laryngeal and tracheal stenosis (n = 33), reflux laryngitis (n = 61), globus pharyngeus (n = 27), dysphagia (n = 25), chronic cough (n = 30), and a group with miscellaneous disorders (n = 18).
 The most common symptoms were hoarseness (71%), cough (51%), globus (47%), and throat clearing (42%).
 Only 43% of the patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation).
 Thus, by traditional symptomatology, GER was occult or silent in the majority of the study population.
 Twenty-eight patients (12%) refused or could not tolerate pH monitoring.
 Of the patients undergoing diagnostic pH monitoring, 62% had abnormal esophageal pH studies, and 30% demonstrated reflux into the pharynx.
 The results of diagnostic pH monitoring for each of the subgroups were as follows (percentage with abnormal studies): carcinoma (71%), stenosis (78%), reflux laryngitis (60%), globus (58%), dysphagia (45%), chronic cough (52%), and miscellaneous (13%).
 The highest yield of abnormal pharyngeal reflux was in the carcinoma group and the stenosis group (58% and 56%, respectively).

"Effect of chronic resistive loading on inspiratory muscles in rats.
 The development of animal models of respiratory muscle training would be useful in studying the physiological effects of training.
 Hence, we studied the effects of chronic resistive loading (CRL) for 5 wk on mass, composition, and mechanics of inspiratory muscles in laboratory rats.
 CRL was produced by means of a tracheal cannula (loaded animals) and results were compared with sham-operated controls.
 Acutely, upper airway obstruction led to a doubling of inspiratory pleural pressure excursion and 25% decrease in respiratory rate.
 We observed no changes in lung pressure-volume curves, nor in the geometry of the respiratory system in loaded compared with control animals.
 Muscle mass normalized for body mass increased in the diaphragm (DI) and the wet weight-to-dry weight ratio increased in the sternomastoid (SM) in loaded compared with control animals.
 Loaded animals demonstrated a decrease in ether extractable (fat) content of the DI and SM muscles but not the gastrocnemius.
 For the DI there was no change in length at which active tension was maximal (Lo), but there was an increase in maximum tension at lengths close to Lo in loaded compared with control rats.
 Endurance did not change, although twitch tensions remained higher in loaded compared with control rats.
 We conclude that 1) alteration of inspiratory muscle structure and function occurs in rats with CRL; 2) the DI and SM demonstrate different adaptive responses to CRL; and 3) although maximum tension increases, endurance does not.

 Epistaxis and gross hematuria subsequently developed, and the patient was found to have a selective Factor X deficiency.
 She received supportive therapy and prothrombin complex concentrates (Factors II, VII, IX, and X), with subsequent resolution of her transient Factor X deficiency.
 Her hospital course, however, was complicated by the development of multiple cerebral infarctions.
 This is the tenth reported case of transient Factor X deficiency not associated with amyloidosis.
 In seven of the previous cases, as in this patient, the deficiency was associated with a preceding upper respiratory infection.
 This is the only case, however, with evidence of inhibitory activity in the plasma that was directed toward Factor X.

"The skier's nose: a model of cold-induced rhinorrhea.
 Cold-induced rhinorrhea (CIR) is a commonly experienced discomfort not previously addressed in the medical literature.
 In a 2-part study, we assessed the prevalence and described the characteristics of CIR and evaluated the efficacy of an anticholinergic nasal spray in its treatment.
 In Part 1, 90 general medical patients at a ski resort clinic were asked to describe their symptoms associated with cold exposure.
 Ninety-six percent reported some degree of CIR; 48% reported moderate to severe CIR.
 Fifty percent had some degree of nasal congestion and 33% reported sneezing.
 Allergic and nonallergic patients described similar degrees of rhinorrhea.
 In Part 2, 14 ski patrollers were given atropine sulfate in saline (AS/S) nasal spray before cold exposure in double-blinded placebo (P) controlled crossover fashion.
 Ninety-two percent noted improvement of CIR with AS/S and 8% experienced no change.
 None of the subjects noted worsening of symptoms, however, one subject reported excessive dryness at the AS/S concentration used.
 All 14 subjects receiving P experienced no change in CIR.
 We conclude that CIR is a distinct clinical syndrome frequently seen with cold temperature exposure, presenting primarily as rhinorrhea and sometimes involving nasal congestion and sneezing.
 Pretreatment with a 0.005% solution AS/S can effectively block CIR with only minimal short-term side effects.

"Nasal valve malfunction resulting from resection of cancer.
 Following cancer resection of the nasal unit, nasal valve malfunction is manifested by the symptoms of nasal stuffiness or difficulty getting air into the nostril.
 These symptoms occur in cases in which the resection is in the alar crease at the junction with the lateral sidewall of the nose.
 Wound scar contracture elevates the alar margin and causes the alar and lateral cartilages to move inward forming a visible and palpable shelf on the lateral wall of the nasal vestibule.
 This displacement of the alar and lateral cartilages and the rigid scar formed between these cartilages render the nasal valve immobile.
 Since it is easier to prevent nasal valve malfunction than to repair it later, wounds that bridge the alar crease or are located in either the alae or lateral sidewall and come within 1 mm of the alar crease with a total diameter of 1.0 cm should be repaired to prevent nasal valve malfunction.
 In the process of repairing deep defects, the overlapping region of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage and the lateral cartilage may be stabilized by a conchal cartilage graft.
 This cartilage graft may be used in combination with reconstruction of the nasal skin with a forehead flap and repair of the nasal lining.
 In the event that the nasal lining is intact, the cartilage graft may be used with a full-thickness skin graft.

"Three mixed venous saturation catheters in patients with circulatory shock and respiratory failure 
 Thirty-one critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure and circulatory shock were divided into three groups.
 Group 1 included 11 patients with an inserted mixed venous saturation (SvO2) catheter using three-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and one detecting fiberoptic filament (Oximetrix opticath catheter); group 2 included eight patients with an inserted SvO2 catheter using two-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and one detecting fiberoptic filament; (Edwards sat-one catheter); group 3 included 12 patients with an inserted SvO2 catheter using two-reference wavelengths and characterized by one transmitting and two detecting fiberoptic filaments.
 Once calibration procedures were performed, SvO2 measured by the catheter and by an hemoximeter OSM 3 (reference value) were compared following each therapeutic intervention.
 Over a period of 1.5 to 6 hours during which the hematocrit value remained unchanged, 119 measurements were obtained in group 1, 91 in group 2 and 181 in group 3.
 The dispersion of SvO2 values was much more pronounced with the two-reference wavelength systems using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments, and the correlation coefficient was significantly higher with the three-reference wavelength system (r = 0.970 for the Oximetrix catheter vs r = 0.855 for the Edwards catheter and r = 0.826 for the Spectramed catheter, p less than 0.001).
 After 24 hours, the spontaneous drifts in the two-reference wavelength systems, using either one or two detecting fiber optic filaments (expressed as the SvO2 value measured by the catheter minus the reference SvO2 value) were significantly higher than the spontaneous drift in the three-reference wavelength system (9.3 +/- 7 percent for the Edwards catheter and +/- 6 +/- 4.1 percent for the Spectramed catheter vs 3.3 +/- 3.1 percent for the Oximetrix catheter, p less than 0.05).
 This study shows that a three-wavelength system is more accurate than a two-wavelength system for measuring acute changes in SvO2.
 The addition of a second detecting fiber optic filament does not seem to improve the accuracy of the system when SvO2 changes occur in conditions of stable hematocrit.

"Cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to glucocorticoids in asthma.
 The aim of the study was to find out whether asthma patients whose airways obstruction is sensitive (CS) or resistant (CR) to corticosteroid treatment also differ in their cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to a potent topical glucocorticoid.
 Corticosteroid resistance was defined by failure of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate to improve by at least 15% after a 2-week trial of corticosteroids (prednisolone 20 mg daily for 1 week, then 40 mg daily for 1 week) despite more than 15% improvement with inhaled beta agonists.
 Beclomethasone dipropionate in concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml, 10 micrograms/ml, 30 micrograms/ml, and 100 micrograms/ml was applied to forearm skin; the site was occluded under plastic and the degree of blanching assessed after 18 h.
 CS asthmatic subjects (n = 31), asthma patients with mild airways obstruction (n = 26), asthma patients taking long-term prednisolone (n = 13), and healthy volunteers showed similar vasoconstrictor responses.
 In CR asthmatic subjects (n = 15), the response (expressed in terms of either blanching intensity or the proportion of patients showing a positive response) was significantly lower than that in the CS group at concentrations of 3 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.01), 10 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.01), and 30 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.05), but not at 100 micrograms/ml.
 This resistance to glucocorticoids in the skin, together with reported evidence of glucocorticoid resistance in peripheral blood leucocytes, suggests a general defect in the ability of tissues to respond to glucocorticoids in CR asthma.

"Fungal diseases of the sinuses.
 With recent advances in medicine, fungal diseases are becoming not only better understood, but also increasingly important in the management of patients with paranasal sinus disease.
 Fungal sinus diseases run the gamut from allergic fungal rhinitis and allergic fungal sinusitis, through fungus balls, to invasive and fulminant fungal sinusitis.
 Allergic fungal sinusitis may be thought of as the sinus counterpart of allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease.
 Patients typically are first seen with chronic sinusitis.
 They may be atopic, and the peripheral blood often shows elevated IgE levels and absolute eosinophil counts.
 Such patients may be managed conservatively, requiring only surgical drainage and corticosteroid therapy.
 Fungus balls are typified by the so-called ""aspergilloma."" Although patients often have some predisposing factor, such as local tissue hypoxia or massive fungal exposure, most patients are not immunocompromised.
 Fungus balls may be treated with the traditional Caldwell-Luc operation or with newer endoscopic procedures.
 Invasive or fulminant fungal sinusitis generally occurs in immunosuppressed patients and merits aggressive surgical excision and debridement, as well as systemic chemotherapy, usually amphotericin B.
 In this article, we review fungal disease of the paranasal sinuses and present findings from our review of patients with chronic sinusitis.

"Treatment of malignant pleural effusions with doxorubicin hydrochloride-containing poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres.
 For the treatment of malignant pleural effusions, we prepared doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin)-containing poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres (ADR-MS).
 In vitro, 50 percent and 100 percent release times of ADR from ADR-MS were 6.3 and 20 days, respectively.
 After intrapleural administration of ADR-MS for seven patients at an ADR dose of 40 mg, ADR was detected in the effusions for more than two weeks; however, ADR concentrations in serum were very small, consistent with minimal transpleural absorption of ADR.
 These results indicated the slow release of ADR into the pleural cavity.
 Furthermore, the amount of drained ADR was less than a few percent of the administered dose.
 In some cases, malignant cells in the effusion disappeared after the treatment.
 No complications related to the procedure occurred, and the patients developed no systemic symptoms.
 One patient died after four months, and the other six patients are alive after 21 to 31 months without reaccumulation of the effusion.
 The local administration of ADR-MS produces a localized high and systemic low concentration of ADR, which could potentially improve the patient's quality of life.

"Does prematurity alter the course of respiratory syncytial virus infection?
 We compared previously healthy prematurely born infants with full-term infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection to evaluate the role of prematurity on the clinical course of the illness.
 During a 5-yr period (1984 to 1989), 484 previously healthy patients were admitted to the hospital with RSV infection.
 No differences were found in the presenting symptoms of respiratory distress, cough, fever or shock, although the premature group was more likely to present with apnea (p less than .001).
 Chest roentgenograms revealed that premature infants had a higher incidence of atelectasis/infiltrate and hyperinflation (p less than .05).
 Premature infants had longer hospital stays as well as a higher Physiologic Stability Index and Therapeutic Intervention Score (p less than .001).
 They were also more likely to receive supplemental oxygen, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and nothing by mouth status (p less than .001).
 We conclude that premature birth increases the risk of more severe and prolonged RSV disease.

"Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor in the adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in critically ill patients.
 An immunoradiometric assay with an upper normal limit of 9 pg/ml was used to measure plasma TNF alpha levels (pl-TNF alpha) in 34 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in 16 patients in whom, despite the presence of risk factors, ARDS did not develop.
 Pl-TNF alpha was elevated in 76% of the patients with ARDS (71 +/- 104 pg/ml) and in 48% of the at-risk patients (47 +/- 73 pg/ml); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.
 In 13 patients studied serially from the onset (Day 0) to the fifth day of ARDS, the peak pl-TNF alpha occurred later than Day 0 in seven subjects.
 Although the highest pl-TNF alpha levels were found in septic patients, moderately elevated values were also observed in 56% of nonseptic subjects.
 We conclude that plasma TNF alpha level is not a marker of ARDS but rather of shock and sepsis.
 These results do not exclude a pathogenic role of TNF alpha in acute lung injury since this cytokine could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs.
 The large incidence of abnormally high could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs.
 The large incidence of abnormally high plasma TNF alpha levels raises important questions on the role of this toxic cytokine in other disorders occurring in critically ill patients.

"Autopsy-verified pulmonary embolism in a surgical department: analysis of the period from 1951 to 1988.
 A retrospective analysis was undertaken of all surgical patients in Malmo, Sweden, during the period from 1951 to 1988 in whom pulmonary emboli were found at autopsy.
 The analysis included a comparison with the earlier analysed and reported time period from 1951 to 1980.
 A continued high frequency of pulmonary embolism at autopsy was seen during the 1980s (20.3 per cent of deaths, 31.7 per cent of autopsies).
 Of the 391 autopsy-verified pulmonary emboli found between 1981 and 1988, 113 (28.9 per cent) were considered fatal, 104 (26.6 per cent) contributed to death and 174 (44.5 per cent) were incidental.
 Few patients had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism before death.
 The overall frequency of major pulmonary embolism in surgical patients remained unchanged (0.3 per cent).
 The frequency of major postoperative pulmonary embolism showed an increase during the 1950s and 1960s (maximum 0.4 per cent) but a decrease in the last 5-year period of the 1970s (0.3 per cent), which has earlier been reported upon.
 This decrease continued during the 1980s (0.2 per cent) (P less than 0.05).
 An increase was found in the number of patients operated on who had autopsy-proven pulmonary embolism and who received thromboprophylaxis.

 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of pretreatment with propranolol on the cardio-respiratory toxicity of bupivacaine, either plain or with epinephrine 1:200,000 (5 micrograms.ml-1) added.
 Adult male Sprague Dawley rats, anaesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, were divided into four groups.
 Groups I and III were pretreated with iv propranolol 150 micrograms.kg-1, and Groups II and IV received iv NS as a placebo.
 Three minutes later, rats in Groups I and II received plain 0.5% bupivacaine, 4 mg.kg-1, and Groups III and IV received 4 mg.kg-1 of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine, 5 micrograms.ml-1 iv.
 Five of eight rats pretreated with propranolol survived (Group I), compared with uniform fatality with NS pretreatment (Group II) (P less than 0.05).
 Addition of epinephrine to the bupivacaine eliminated the protective effect of propranolol.
 All rats pretreated with propranolol (Group III) or NS (Group IV) died when given bupivacaine with epinephrine.

"Respiratory muscle deoxygenation during exercise in patients with heart failure demonstrated with near-infrared spectroscopy.
 Exertional dyspnea in patients with heart failure may be due, in part, to respiratory muscle underperfusion.
 Near-infrared spectroscopy is a new technique that permits noninvasive assessment of skeletal muscle oxygenation by monitoring changes in near-infrared light absorption.
 With use of near-infrared spectroscopy, serratus anterior muscle oxygenation during maximal bicycle exercise was compared in 10 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 16 +/- 5%) and 7 age-matched normal subjects.
 Oxygen consumption (VO2), minute ventilation (VE) and arterial saturation were also measured.
 Changes in difference in absorption between 760 and 800 nm, expressed in arbitrary units, were used to detect muscle deoxygenation.
 Minimal change in this difference in absorption occurred in normal subjects during exercise, whereas patients with heart failure exhibited progressive changes throughout exercise consistent with respiratory muscle deoxygenation (peak exercise: normal 3 +/- 6, heart failure 12 +/- 4 near-infrared arbitrary units, p less than 0.001).
 At comparable work loads patients with heart failure had significantly greater minute ventilation and respiratory rate but similar tidal volume when contrasted with normal subjects.
 However, at peak exercise normal subjects achieved significantly greater minute ventilation and tidal volume with a comparable respiratory rate.
 No significant arterial desaturation occurred during exercise in either group.
 These findings indicate that respiratory muscle deoxygenation occurs in patients with heart failure during exercise.
 This deoxygenation may contribute to the exertional dyspnea experienced by such patients.

"Priming by platelet-activating factor of endotoxin-induced lung injury and cardiovascular shock.
 Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a glycerophospholipid known for its unusual potent vasoactive and proinflammatory activities.
 The present study examined whether PAF might serve as a priming factor in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) synthesis, cardiovascular shock, and lung injury in anesthetized rats.
 Intravenous infusion of PAF (1 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes, n = 5) alone or endotoxin (0.1 micrograms/kg i.v.
 bolus, n = 5) failed to alter blood pressure, serum TNF alpha and thromboxane B2, platelet and leukocyte count, and hematocrit, nor was lung histology, myeloperoxidase activity, and water content changed.
 In contrast, the combined administration of PAF and endotoxin markedly elevated serum TNF alpha (1,359 +/- 362 pg/ml, n = 5, p less than 0.01) and thromboxane B2 (43 +/- 5 pg/100 microliters, n = 8, p less than 0.01) along with hypotension, hemoconcentration, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
 Most notably, the combined regimen caused neutrophil aggregation, adhesion, and accumulation into the lung parenchyma along with platelet-fibrin deposits in postcapillary venules, pulmonary edema, and increased lung myeloperoxidase activity.
 The role of PAF in this process was confirmed by 1) the prevention of the priming effect by pretreatment with the PAF antagonist BN 50739 (n = 5), and 2) the failure of lyso-PAF, the cardinal nonactive PAF-metabolite, to prime for endotoxin-induced production of TNF alpha (n = 4).
 These data suggest that PAF could serve as a key mediator in priming for endotoxin-induced tissue injury, especially the typical pulmonary pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome, a severe pathological outcome of septic shock, burns, and multiple organ injury.

 Mean duration of orotracheal intubation was 19.9 days, mean age 65 yr, and no patient had a concomitant neurologic deficit.
 All patients had a modified barium swallow with videofluoroscopy.
 All patients had at least one defect of 11 defects characterized.
 There was a mean of six defects/patient.
 The most common defects were delayed triggering of the swallow response (present in all patients) and pharyngeal pooling of contrast material (n = 9).

"Cytomegalovirus infections after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs in approximately 50% of all recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants and is seen more frequently in CMV-seropositive patients than in CMV-seronegative patients.
 Sources of infection include reactivation of latent endogenous virus, blood products from CMV-seropositive blood donors, and the use of marrow from a CMV-seropositive donor for a CMV-seronegative recipient.
 The most common and severe clinical syndrome associated with CMV infection in allogeneic transplant recipients is interstitial pneumonia, which occurs in approximately 15% of patients.
 Risk factors for CMV pneumonia include old age, conditioning with total-body irradiation, and severe graft-vs.-host disease.
 The rapid diagnosis of CMV pneumonia has been facilitated by immunochemical staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or by centrifugation of cell cultures with CMV monoclonal antibodies.
 The treatment of CMV pneumonia remains problematic, but therapy with a combination of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus ganciclovir has resulted in survival rates substantially better than those achieved in previous trials of antiviral therapy.
 In CMV-seronegative patients, CMV infection and pneumonia can be prevented or modified by the use of CMV-seronegative blood products and IVIG.
 IVIG may also have the additional benefits of preventing other infectious complications and graft-vs.-host disease in patients receiving CMV-seronegative blood products.
 For CMV-seropositive patients, effective prophylaxis for CMV reactivation and pneumonia has not yet been established, but a clinical trial of prophylactic ganciclovir is now under way.

"Pleuritis as a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis.
 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency with which tuberculous pleuritis is a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis and to compare the clinical manifestations of reactivation tuberculous pleuritis with ""classic"" tuberculous pleuritis, in which chest roentgenograms reveal no parenchymal infiltrates.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the medical records of 59 patients in whom tuberculous pleuritis was confirmed by histologic findings or mycobacterial culture.
 Twenty-seven patients (46%) had typical chest roentgenographic findings of reactivation tuberculosis, whereas 32 (54%) had classic tuberculous pleuritis.
 The clinical and laboratory features of these two groups were compared.
 RESULTS: Symptoms were more prolonged and pleural fluid glucose and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were more markedly abnormal in patients with reactivation pleuritis than in those with classic pleuritis, suggesting a more chronic inflammatory process in the former group.
 Compared with patients with classic tuberculous pleuritis, those with reactivation pleuritis had a lower frequency of reactive tuberculin skin tests (61% versus 88%) and granulomatous pleural inflammation (25% versus 72%), but a higher bacillary burden, manifest by a higher frequency of positive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (50% versus 0%) and positive mycobacterial cultures from sputum (60% versus 23%) and pleural fluid (91% versus 66%).
 CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, tuberculous pleuritis was a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis in 46% (27 of 59) of patients.
 Tuberculous pleuritis is a more chronic process in patients with reactivation disease than in those with classic pleuritis.
 The lower frequency of reactive tuberculin skin tests and granuloma formation, combined with the higher bacillary burden in patients with reactivation pleuritis, suggest that these patients mount a less effective immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection than do patients with the classic form of tuberculous pleuritis.

"Cellular immunity in current active pulmonary tuberculosis.
 A group of 10 patients with recently diagnosed pulmonary TB were studied and compared to 10 bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunized healthy individuals.
 Cellular immune mechanisms were explored in vitro utilizing fresh and precultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to PHA, PPD, and recall antigens (SK/SD and CA).
 Proliferative assays were also carried out in the presence of either each patient's serum (autologous serum) or cocultured with CD3(+)-depleted adherent cells.
 Serum measurements of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor and synthesis of IL-2 generated by mononuclear cells stimulated with PPD and SK/SD were also performed.
 Patient sera were able to inhibit autologous as well as allogeneic cell responses, and a significant adherent cell suppressive effect was observed.
 As a whole the group of patients showed decreased blast transformation to PPD, preserved proliferative responses to other recall antigens, and a low PPD-induced generation of IL-2.
 Furthermore, as possible evidence of preactivated T cells, these patients demonstrated high soluble IL-2 receptor serum levels.
 Early compromise of specific cell-mediated immunity, including IL-2 abnormalities, may be of significance in newly diagnosed pulmonary TB.

 Twenty-two patients have undergone 23 single lung transplants between March 1980 and April 1990 at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
 The actuarial survival rate is 77.27% at 12 months and 72.73% at 24 months.
 There have been no instances of bronchial dehiscence or stenosis, even though 13 of the patients were on a program of preoperative prednisone, every patient had high-dose perioperative methylprednisolone, and omental wraps were not used on any bronchial anastomosis.
 Of particular interest is the fact that three patients had primary pulmonary hypertension, three had secondary pulmonary hypertension, and 10 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due in five cases to an alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.
 Each of these entities was previously thought to contraindicate single lung transplantation.
 Donor selection was based on an oxygen tension/inspired oxygen concentration ratio greater than 300, donor/recipient chest circumference within 3 inches, clear chest x-ray film, negative sputum Gram stain, and less than 6-hour estimated ischemic time.
 Harvest technique included donor prostaglandin E1 500 micrograms, topical slush, and pulmonoplegia with cold Euro-Collins solution.
 The heart and lung were separated in situ rather than the heart lung block being removed.
 A telescoping bronchial anastomosis was performed with 4-0 Prolene (not absorbable) sutures.
 We conclude that single lung transplantation has evolved into a simple operation, necessitating meticulous preoperative and postoperative care, which can be performed on a wide spectrum of critically ill patients with an acceptable mortality rate.

"Beware of malignant lymphoma masquerading as facial inflammatory processes.
 Considerable difficulty exists in diagnosing some sarcomas, lymphomas, and carcinomas that develop in the head and neck.
 Frequently these malignancies appear clinically as masquerading inflammatory disease processes.
 Recognition of these rare lesions usually occurs only after the inflammatory-like symptoms have failed to respond to conventional management, necessitating a more extensive evaluation and even repeated biopsies.
 The use of special stains, immunohistochemical studies, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence techniques may still produce an inconclusive histopathologic diagnosis.
 This case report documents a rare extranodal malignant lymphoma of the right maxillary sinus that mimicked an odontogenic infection with superimposed chronic rhinosinusitis in a 19-year-old sailor.
 The cause of his chief complaint and presenting symptoms challenged the astuteness of clinicians, surgeons, and histopathologists on two continents and the high seas.
 Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for malignancy when inflammatory-like lesions fail to respond to the usual appropriate management.
 Indications for early biopsy of suspect lesions and aggressive follow-up are emphasized.

"Relationship of fluid filtration to lung vascular pressure during edema.
 Effect of edema on the relationship between rate of fluid filtration and vascular pressure was studied in ventilated isolated dog lung lobes blood-perfused at constant flow.
 Constant rate of lobe weight gain (S), representing transvascular fluid flux, was obtained at different venous pressures (Pv) as Pv was increased stepwise from 2 to 40 and then similarly decreased from 40 to 2 Torr (n = 6).
 In another group (n = 6), edema was maximized by reversing the sequence of Pv change; S was obtained during similar Pv steps as Pv was decreased from 40 to 2 and then returned to 40 Torr.
 In both groups, delta S was disproportionately greater for delta Pv at higher Pv's, with S vs.
 Pv fit by an exponential curve (P less than 0.001).
 The exponential relationship was independent of lung hydration inasmuch as greater edema on the second limb of Pv change did not alter the curve (P greater than 0.05).
 At 144% weight gain, interstitial compliance was 55.5 +/- 26.8 ml.100 g-1.Torr-1 (n = 10).
 Interstitial pressure reportedly remains constant, i.e., fails to increase to further buffer fluid filtration, after transition of the lung interstitium from low to high compliance at approximately 40% lung weight gain.
 If so, then the exponential S vs.
 Pv relationship observed in the present study at elevated interstitial compliance does not appear related to tissue pressure-buffering effects.

"Inverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses: a study of 67 patients.
 Retrospectively, 67 patients with inverted nasal papillomas were studied.
 In 12, the lesions were localized exclusively on the nasal septum.
 In 55, the lesion involved the lateral wall and/or the paranasal sinuses.
 There was a male predominance of 3:1.
 After histological revision the most dominating epithelial type was found to be transitional.
 Inverted papilloma was in one patient associated with squamous cell carcinoma.
 Ten per cent suffered recurrences from 6 to 37 months after the primary surgical procedure.
 We found that limited septal lesions could be managed by an intranasal procedure but lateral rhinotomy is recommended as the procedure of choice in the treatment of inverted papilloma of the lateral wall.

"Hamman-Rich syndrome revisited 
 In this article, we retrospectively review 29 cases of Hamman-Rich syndrome.
 As in some other recent reports, we have used the term ""acute interstitial pneumonia"" to emphasize the clinical and pathologic features of these cases and to distinguish them from the more common chronic interstitial pneumonias, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
 Of the 29 patients, 12 survived, some after a long and complicated hospitalization.
 The histologic features were those of organizing diffuse alveolar damage, and some patients, including survivors, had extensive fibroblastic distortion of lung parenchyma.
 The overall survival among these patients was not appreciably different from the survival of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome in general.

"Roentgenologic features of pulmonary blastomycosis.
 In 35 cases of pulmonary blastomycosis, the roentgenologic features were as follows: consolidation 26%, mass 31%, intermediate-sized nodules 6%, miliary pattern 11%, solitary cavity 9%, fibrotic and cavitary changes 6%, interstitial pattern 6%, diffuse alveolar involvement 3%, and mixed alveolar and interstitial infiltrate 3%.
 All symptomatic cases of consolidation were acute (symptoms for less than 1 month), and most were in young patients (mean age, 34 years).
 Consolidation constituted 58% of the acute cases in this series.
 Two of the nine cases of consolidation were asymptomatic epidemic cases detected by screening.
 A pulmonary mass was the most common initial manifestation in this series; it tended to occur in patients with chronic symptoms (more than 1 month).
 The mass was considered suggestive enough of bronchogenic carcinoma to necessitate resection in 55% of cases.
 The military form of pulmonary blastomycosis occurred in older patients with disseminated disease.
 Fibrotic and cavitary disease was chronic in nature.
 The presence of intermediate-sized nodules elsewhere in the lung proved to be a helpful diagnostic finding in several patients with consolidation, mass, or cavitary disease.
 Hilar adenopathy, postinfectious calcification, chest wall invasion, and pleural effusion occurred infrequently or not at all in this series.

"Association of postoperative apnea, airway obstruction, and hypoxemia in former premature infants.
 Airway obstruction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of apnea in premature infants who have not previously undergone anesthesia.
 To determine the role of airway obstruction in postoperative apnea, we studied 74 former premature infants by integrated recordings of nasal airflow, pneumocardiography, and pulse oximetry during the initial 2 h of recovery from inhalational anesthesia.
 Apnea (greater than 6 s) was classified as central, obstructive, or mixed, wherein mixed apnea consisted of central and obstructive apnea within the same apneic episode.
 Postoperative apnea was observed in 23 infants, ranging in age from 31-48 weeks postconception: 12 had inguinal herniorrhaphy (hernia group) and 11 had other procedures (other group).
 Of the 268 apneic episodes in the hernia group, 73% were central, 6% obstructive, and 21% mixed.
 Infants in the other group had 505 apneic episodes, with a distribution nearly identical to that in the hernia group.
 Central and mixed apnea occurred in all infants experiencing apnea, except in 1 infant, who had only central apnea, whereas obstructive apnea occurred in only one third of the apneic infants.
 Arterial hemoglobin desaturation was significantly more frequent at the end of mixed and obstructive apnea than after central apnea (P less than 0.01).
 In both groups, arterial hemoglobin O2 saturation (SpO2) decreased to less than 80% in approximately 35% of mixed and obstructive apneic episodes, compared to approximately 5% of central apneic episodes.
 SpO2 remained greater than or equal to 90% in over 80% of central apneic episodes, compared to 40% of mixed and obstructive apneic episodes.

"Medication adherence patterns in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 While medical treatment of COPD has advanced, the failure to adhere to regimens for medication poses a significant barrier to effective management.
 Furthermore, no data are available regarding adherence for patients within the United States.
 Data from this investigation indicate that 78 outpatients from a medical center in the southeastern region of the United States were prescribed an average of 6.26 medications with both various dosing schedules and different modes of administration.
 Adherence was poor, with 42 patients (54 percent) underutilizing medications, 39 patients (50 percent) overutilizing medications during periods of respiratory distress, and 24 patients (31 percent) employing ineffective inhaler dosing techniques.
 Prescription patterns and adherence were not associated with demographic variables; however, adherence was related to classes of medication and situational variables.

"A comparison of the effects of ipratropium bromide and metaproterenol sulfate in acute exacerbations of COPD.
 Thirty-two patients presenting with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were entered into the following double-blind, crossover study.
 First (time 0), patients inhaled either ipratropium bromide (54 micrograms) or metaproterenol sulfate (1.95 mg) via a metered dose inhaler (MDI) attached to a device (Inspirease) (phase 1).
 After 90 minutes, they inhaled whichever of the two medications they had not received in phase 1.
 This is referred to as phase 2.
 Pulmonary function (FEV1 and FVC) was measured at time 0, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following phase 1 treatment, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes following phase 2 treatment (120, 150, and 180 minutes from the start of the study).
 Arterial blood gas samples (n = 20) were obtained at entry into the study and 30 and 90 minutes after phase 1 medication.
 The groups did not differ in age, degree of airway obstruction, hypoxemia, or theophylline usage at the start of the study.
 In phase 1, at 90 minutes, pulmonary function in both groups significantly and similarly improved.
 For ipratropium, FEV1 improved from 0.62 +/- 0.08 L to 0.88 +/- 0.11 L (p less than 0.01) and for metaproterenol FEV1 improved from 0.69 +/- 0.06 to 0.92 +/- 0.09 L (p less than 0.01).
 There was no further improvement with phase 2 treatment for either group.
 Thirty minutes after inhaling ipratropium, there was a small but significant rise in PO2 (5.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) while metaproterenol inhalation resulted in a 6.2 +/- 1.2 mm Hg decline in PO2 (p less than 0.05).
 These changes were not sustained at 90 minutes.
 We concluded that for acute exacerbations of COPD, both ipratropium and metaproterenol are effective medications when administered via an MDI attached to a device (Inspirease).
 However, ipratropium may be a safer choice as it initially did not cause a decline in blood oxygenation.

"Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy for retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma.
 From December 1981 to December 1989, 20 patients with primary or recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma received 4000 to 5000 cGy of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in conjunction with surgical resection and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT).
 Seventeen of 20 patients underwent complete (14 patients) or partial (3 patients) resection.
 Three patients had shown evidence of metastases after EBRT by the time of surgery.
 The 4-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival rates of the 17 patients undergoing resection were 81% and 64%, respectively.
 Twelve patients received IORT at the time of resection for microscopic disease (10 patients) or gross residual sarcoma (2 patients).
 Of the ten patients receiving IORT for microscopic tumor, one patient has died of local failure and peritoneal sarcomatosis and two patients have died of distant metastases only.
 The remaining seven patients are disease-free.
 One patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has experienced a local failure 1 year after IORT and is without disease 7 years after salvage chemotherapy.
 The other patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has died of local failure.
 Five patients did not receive IORT at the time of resection because of the extensive size of the tumor bed.
 Three of these patients are disease-free with one patient alive with lung metastases and one patient dying of hepatic metastases.
 Aggressive radiation and surgical procedures appear to provide satisfactory resectability and local control with acceptable tolerance.

"Behavioral arousal in newborn infants and its association with termination of apnea.
 Arousal is an important protective mechanism that aids in the resolution of obstructive sleep apnea in adults and children, but its role in neonatal apnea has not been investigated.
 The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of arousal in the termination of apnea in preterm infants.
 Videorecording was used to identify spontaneous behavioral arousal in a group of healthy full-term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 10) infants before and during polygraphic monitoring of cardiorespiratory variables and in a group of preterm infants with apnea (n = 10) during similar polygraphic monitoring.
 Spontaneous arousal rates (mean +/- SE) in full-term infants before and during polygraphic monitoring were 0.18 +/- 0.03 and 0.23 +/- 0.07 episodes/min, respectively.
 Corresponding values in nonapneic preterm infants were 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 episodes/min.
 In apneic preterm infants, mean spontaneous arousal rate during polygraphic recording was 0.26 +/- 0.02, but it was considerably higher during apneic sleep periods (0.59 +/- 0.17) than during nonapneic sleep periods (0.25 +/- 0.01).
 The frequency of occurrence of arousal was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in long vs.
 short apnea, mixed vs.
 central apnea, and severe vs.
 mild apnea.
 Although a clear association between arousal and apneic resolution was observed in preterm infants, lack of arousal responses in a large number of apneic episodes suggests that behavioral arousal is not essential for the termination of apnea in these infants.

"Aminophylline therapy for acute bronchospastic disease in the emergency room 
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of aminophylline in the treatment of acute exacerbations of bronchospastic disease when used in addition to inhaled beta-agonists and intravenous corticosteroids.
 DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study.
 PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-three adult patients with either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the emergency department with asthma or wheezing.
 INTERVENTIONS: All patients received therapy with both aerosolized metaproterenol and intravenous methyl-prednisolone.
 Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a loading dose of aminophylline followed by a routine infusion (n = 65) or an equal volume of placebo as a loading dose and infusion (n = 68).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At discharge from the emergency department, the median serum theophylline concentration for the aminophylline group was 54 mumol/L (9.7 mg/L).
 The two groups showed no differences (P greater than 0.2) in measurements of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at baseline or at 60 or 120 minutes after aminophylline administration.
 Neither patient satisfaction nor physician assessment of response to therapy differed between the two groups.
 There was no difference (P greater than 0.2) in the frequency of side effects, except for a trend toward a higher frequency of nausea (P = 0.13) in the aminophylline group.
 There was, however, a threefold decrease in the hospital admission rate for patients treated with aminophylline (6%) compared with placebo recipients (21%) (P = 0.016).
 CONCLUSION: Aminophylline, in doses producing levels just below the commonly accepted therapeutic range, appears to decrease hospital admissions in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 This finding, if confirmed in larger studies, may represent a substantial cost savings.

 The aldolase isozymes A, B, and C in tumor tissues (63) and sera (104) of patients with lung cancer were determined with an enzyme immunoassay system, compared with normal lung tissues (13), and the sera of normal healthy subjects (100).
 Tissue aldolase A and C concentrations were enhanced in 83% (52/63) and 51% (32/63) of patients with lung cancer, respectively, regardless of histologic type or stage (P less than 0.01).
 But aldolase B was not elevated in tissue levels.
 In the sera of patients with lung cancer, there were no significant elevations of the isozymes.
 Immunohistochemically aldolase A and C stained more intensely in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells than those in normal tissues.
 These results indicate lung cancer cells contain enhanced tissue levels of aldolase A and C.

"A protocol for the safe administration of debrisoquine in biochemical epidemiologic research protocols for hospitalized patients.
 The genetically determined ability to metabolize the antihypertensive drug debrisoquine has been proposed as a genetic risk factor for primary carcinomas of the lung.
 To test this hypothesis, the metabolism of the drug was evaluated in a case control study.
 The subjects were characterized by their ability to metabolize debrisoquine after receiving a test dose of the drug followed by the collection of an 8-hour urine sample.
 They were classified by laboratory analysis into one of the following three groups: extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers.
 Poor metabolizers comprise 10% of the population and are unable to hydroxylate the drug.
 This group was expected to be at highest risk for deleterious effects from this medication.
 A protocol was created that included patient education and blood pressure monitoring to administer this medication safely to a group of patients with cancer who were already compromised.
 Although poor metabolizers showed a small decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, no significant hypotensive episodes or clinical sequelae were observed in any of the groups.
 These data suggest that debrisoquine can be administered safely in a controlled clinical setting and will be useful for the characterization of lung cancer patients in biochemical epidemiology studies.

"The impact of respiratory viral infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 Respiratory viruses have been implicated in pulmonary exacerbations of CF and in the long-term course of pulmonary dysfunction in these patients.
 However, the data are by no means complete and there is the clear need for more intensive evaluations of the role of viral pathogens in this population.
 Further controlled prospective studies assessing the impact of viral infections in large cohorts of patients with CF are still necessary.
 Placebo-controlled, antiviral treatment protocols also should be initiated.
 In clinical practice at the present time, patients with CF should be assessed for respiratory viral infections, at least at the time of hospitalizations for pulmonary deterioration.
 This assessment should include obtaining specimens from the respiratory tract for viral cultures and rapid respiratory viral antigen detection.
 Identifying a respiratory viral infection may alter clinical care.
 The patient can be isolated appropriately, and it may be possible to reduce the intensive use of expensive and potentially toxic parenteral antibiotics.
 The role of antiviral therapy in these patients must await further evaluations.
 The mechanisms of the short- and long-term effects of respiratory viruses in patients with CF have not been defined.
 However, pathophysiologic studies conducted in normal children and adults allow the development of several plausible hypotheses.
 The definition of mechanisms of injury in this population must be a priority, since it may influence clinical practice.
 If airway obstruction is the principal mechanism of viral-induced injury, therapeutic approaches designed to relieve the obstruction would be most appropriate.
 For example, if the obstruction resulted from induced or aggravated reactive airway disease, the current common practice of prescribing chronic bronchodilator therapy would be appropriate.
 This therapy might be especially suited to those experiencing frequent viral infections.
 In addition, the administration of bronchodilators to patients during acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease caused by viruses might be of clinical benefit.
 If, on the other hand, the principal mechanism of viral-induced injury is found to be through synergistic interaction with bacteria, the current practice of aggressive antimicrobial therapy would remain appropriate.

 Eleven of these children (eight girls and three boys) all more than 10 years of age (mean follow up 8.1 years; range 3-13) had thrombotic episodes (9%).
 Thrombosis was one of the presenting signs in seven patients; in five it was associated with typical symptoms of SLE, and in the other two the thrombotic episode was isolated and diagnosis of SLE was delayed one and three years.
 Of a total of 16 thrombotic episodes (six of which were recurrent), 14 involved the leg veins, and in four there was associated pulmonary embolism.
 There were two episodes that affected cerebral arteries.
 The American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE as well as the incidence of lupus anticoagulant, positive direct Coombs test, and vasculitis in this group of patients was compared with the incidence in patients with SLE but no thrombosis.
 Only lupus anticoagulant was significantly associated with thrombotic episodes: eight of 11 (73%) of patients with SLE and thrombotic (arterial or venous) episodes had lupus anticoagulant compared with only 10 of 74 patients (14%) with no history of thrombotic events in the same age group.

 The study group also had a greater number of valve replacements than did the control group (p less than 0.01).
 Patients with obstructive disease had more respiratory complications than did patients with restrictive disease (p less than 0.05).

 Overall survival for the patients was 51 percent at one year, 22 percent at three years, and 11 percent at five years.
 Age, sex, and side of primary tumor had no influence on survival.
 Improved survival was correlated with good PS, metastases limited to single organ, and removal of the primary tumor.

 From June 1988 to February 1989, we enrolled 36 patients with human immunodeficiency virus into a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy and toxicity of aerosolized pentamidine (AP) as secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 Each patient underwent spirometric evaluations before and after aerosolized treatment.
 There was no significant difference in the results of baseline pulmonary function tests between the two groups.
 Eleven patients (65 percent) in the AP group developed cough but only four demonstrated significant reduction in the forced expiratory flow rates after AP; four patients (21 percent) in the placebo group developed cough, but no significant change in the expiratory flow rates was noted.
 All bronchospastic episodes were self-limited and symptomatically responded to remedial inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) treatment.
 We conclude that AP treatment is frequently associated with coughing attacks (65 percent), but the actual incidence of bronchospasm on spirometry is much lower (24 percent) and is generally quite mild.

 A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of human surfactant given intratracheally at birth (prophylactic) versus rescue administration after the onset of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was conducted among preterm infants born at 24 to 29 weeks of gestation.
 Singleton fetuses were randomly assigned to receive (1) placebo (air), (2) prophylactic surfactant treatment, or (3) rescue surfactant treatment; infants of multiple births received either (1) prophylactic or (2) rescue treatment.
 Of 282 potentially eligible fetuses, 246 infants received treatments at birth and 200 infants had RDS.
 Outcomes are presented both as an intention-to-treat analysis (including infants who met exclusion criteria at or after birth) and as a full treatment protocol analysis for those infants with RDS and likely to benefit from surfactant.
 Preterm infants (mean 1.0 kg birth weight, 27 to 28 weeks of gestational age) randomly assigned to receive prophylactic treatment received surfactant soon after birth; those assigned to receive rescue surfactant had instillation at a mean age of 220 minutes if the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio was less than or equal to 2.0 and no phosphatidylglycerol was detected in either amniotic fluid or initial airway aspirate, oxygen requirements were a fraction of inspired oxygen of greater than 0.5, and mean airway pressure was greater than or equal to 7 cm H2O from 2 to 12 hours after birth.
 Up to four treatment doses (or air) were permitted within 48 hours; approximately 60% of surfactant-treated infants required two or more doses.
 Surfactant-treated infants had significantly less pulmonary interstitial emphysema than placebo-treated infants (p = 0.02), but there were no other significant differences in mortality rates or morbidity.
 Indexes of oxygenation and ventilation were improved in surfactant recipients during the first 24 hours.
 An intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences between infants given placebo and surfactant-treated infants or between prophylactic- and rescue-treated infants; an improved total mortality rate (p = 0.002) was found among surfactant-treated infants in Helsinki but not in San Diego.
 Among infants with RDS, the total mortality rate was significantly improved (p = 0.004) with surfactant treatment but not the proportion alive and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 28 days (p = 0.052), or the proportion alive and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 38 weeks of postconceptional age (p = 0.18) to adjust for differences in prematurity.

 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or in asthmatic patients.
 DESIGN: Case-control study.
 SETTING: Tertiary care, referral-based medical center.
 PATIENTS: Of 28,978 intravenous urographic contrast media procedures done from July 1987 to June 1988, 49 patients experienced moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction.
 Medical records from these 49 reactors were compared with those from a control group matched for gender, age, and date and type of contrast study who received intravenous urographic contrast media without adverse reaction.
 MAIN RESULTS: Patients exposed to beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma comprised 39% (19 of 49) of reactors, compared to 16% (13 of 83) of matched controls (odds ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.45 to 8.15; P = 0.005).
 Exposure to beta-blockers was 27% among reactors and 12% in matched controls (odds ratio, 2.67; CI, 1.01 to 7.05; P = 0.036).
 Asthma was found in 12% of reactors and 4% of controls; after correction for beta-blocker use, asthma was also associated with increased risk for anaphylactoid reaction (odds ratio, 4.54; CI, 1.03 to 20.05; P = 0.046).
 Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, asthmatic patients were at greater risk for anaphylactoid reaction with bronchospasm (P = 0.02).
 Five of 13 reactors receiving beta-blockers became hypotensive, and three needed hospitalization.
 Compared with nonasthmatic patients not taking beta-blockers, patients exposed to beta-blocking drugs were almost nine times (odds ratio, 8.7; CI, 0.81 to 93.5; P = 0.075) more likely to be hospitalized after an anaphylactoid reaction.
 CONCLUSION: Increased risk for moderate to severe anaphylactoid reaction from intravenous urographic contrast media exists in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockers or with asthma.
 These patients are appropriate target populations for efforts to reduce risk before intravenous urographic contrast media are administered.

"Results of bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures from adult sickle cell disease patients with the acute chest syndrome.
 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of the acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease based on bronchoscopically obtained lower airway cultures and to describe the clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic features of the acute chest syndrome in a series composed entirely of adult patients with sickle cell disease.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the hospital records from 19 episodes (18 patients) of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease (greater than or equal to 19 years of age) who had undergone flexible bronchoscopy to obtain lower airway cultures between January 1979 and July 1987.
 We also recorded patients' clinical, laboratory, and roentgenographic characteristics.
 RESULTS: Pneumonia was diagnosed in four of 19 episodes (21%) of acute chest syndrome based on quantitative cultures obtained at bronchoscopy.
 The pneumonia was caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in two patients and mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the other two patients.
 Forty-four of 45 blood cultures were negative, and one grew Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was considered a contaminant.
 Chest roentgenograms revealed lower lobe involvement in 17 episodes (90%) and bilateral infiltrates in six (32%).
 Pleural effusions occurred in seven episodes (37%), and pleural fluid samples obtained from five of these revealed sterile exudates.
 CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective study suggest that bacterial pneumonia is an uncommon cause of acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease.
 These results are consistent with previous retrospective studies using noninvasive techniques to diagnose pneumonia.
 Nevertheless, there appeared to be no reliable noninvasive variables that could accurately differentiate between patients with and without pneumonia and, consequently, we recommend empiric antibiotic therapy in addition to usual supportive care of these patients.

"A rat model of prolonged pulmonary infection due to nontypable Haemophilus influenzae.
 Pulmonary colonization and infection with nontypable (unencapsulated) Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) occurs commonly in the setting of chronic lung diseases.
 Because the study of NTHI pulmonary infection in animal models has been limited by the rapid clearance of organisms, a model of persistent pulmonary infection was developed.
 Groups of rats were inoculated by transtracheal instillation of viable NTHI suspended in broth or semisolid agar.
 Some rats had received hexamethylphosphoramide (HMP) in drinking water before inoculation to cause respiratory epithelial mucosal damage.
 Groups of animals were sacrificed serially.
 Lungs were cultured quantitatively and their gross and microscopic anatomy examined.
 NTHI was recovered in small quantities from few broth-inoculated rats after the first day of infection and in none after Day 7.
 In contrast, NTHI was recovered from the majority of animals and in greater amounts through 2 wk after agar-borne inoculation.
 HMP pretreatment further enhanced recovery through 4 wk after inoculation with an agar vehicle.
 The pulmonary inflammatory reaction was brief in broth-inoculated rats.
 The longer persistence of gross and histologic changes seen in agar-infected lungs paralleled the enhanced recovery of NTHI.
 Abscess formation occurred at 7 to 14 days in some agar-inoculated animals.
 Thus pulmonary inoculation of NTHI in a viscous vehicle resulted in perpetuation of infection and inflammatory response, and previous damage to respiratory mucosal epithelium induced by HMP further enhanced such infection.

"Characterization of the morphonuclear features and DNA ploidy of typical and atypical carcinoids and small cell carcinomas of the lung.
 The authors analyzed several cytomorphonuclear parameters related to chromatin distribution and DNA ploidy in typical and atypical carcinoids and in small cell lung cancers.
 Nuclear measurements and analysis were performed with a SAMBA 200 (TITN, Grenoble, France) cell image processor with software allowing the discrimination of parameters computed on cytospin preparations of Feulgen-stained nuclei extracted from deparaffinized tumor tissues.
 The authors' results indicate a significant increase in DNA content--assessed by integrated optical density (IOD)--from typical carcinoids to small cell lung carcinomas, with atypical carcinoids showing an intermediate value.
 Parameters related to hyperchromatism (short and long run length and variance of optical density) also characterize the atypical carcinoids as being intermediate between typical carcinoids and small cell lung cancers.
 The systematic measurement of these cytomorphonuclear parameters seems to define an objective, reproducible ""scale"" of differentiation that helps to define the atypical carcinoid and may be of value in establishing cytologic criteria for differential diagnosis.

 Twenty-five patients were treated with a laryngeal stent for potentially reversible chronic aspiration of life-threatening magnitude.
 The causes of the intractable aspiration were diverse and included chronic neurologic disease, extensive head and neck surgery, and severe gastroesophageal reflux.
 The advantages of this technique are noted in comparison to those of more invasive procedures.
 Disadvantages of the laryngeal stent and complications encountered are also covered.
 The long-term results show that all but one patient had a significant improvement in their chronic aspiration with the stent in place.
 However, only eight patients achieved adequate oral deglutition without aspiration following stent removal.

"Acute lung injury following reperfusion after ischemia in the hind limbs of rats.
 In this study, we proposed that oxygen free radicals participate in the acute pulmonary injury that follows limb ischemia/reperfusion.
 Using an established model of hind limb ischemia, reproducible lung injury occurred after reperfusion.
 Lung microvascular permeability was measured with 125I-BSA and increased two-fold after 30 minutes of reperfusion.
 Pulmonary injury was blocked with DMSO, DMTU, allopurinol, indomethacin, and SOD plus catalase.
 The degree of pulmonary neutrophil sequestration as assessed by tissue myeloperoxidase activity was significantly diminished in animals pretreated with antioxidants.
 Pretreatment with indomethacin did not attenuate the neutrophil sequestration within the pulmonary parenchyma.
 These data suggest that increased lung microvascular permeability and neutrophil accumulation occur following hind limb ischemia/reperfusion.
 Therapeutic interventions with oxygen radical inhibitors blocked this process, while the prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, only reduced lung permeability.

 The exact role or even the necessity for a functioning larynx in the production of an efficient cough is unknown.
 This study compares the cough intensity of 10 laryngectomees with a control group of 10 individuals with a larynx.
 There is no significant difference in the peak flow but the time taken to reach the peak flow is prolonged in the laryngectomees.
 The supramaximal expiratory flow is thus absent.
 The larynx is not essential for coughing although the different pattern may be less efficient.
 This simple test may have diagnostic value in assessing the larynx.

"Impact of HIV on tuberculosis in Zambia: a cross sectional study 
 OBJECTIVE--To examine the contribution of HIV infection to the apparently increasing incidence of tuberculosis in central Africa.
 DESIGN--Cross sectional study.
 SETTING--Outpatient clinic in teaching hospital, Lusaka, Zambia.
 PATIENTS--346 Adult patients with tuberculosis.
 RESULTS--Overall, 206 patients (60%; 95% confidence interval 54% to 65%) were positive for HIV--in one or both assays used.
 The peaks for both tuberculosis and HIV infection were among men aged 25-34 years and women aged 14-24 years.
 Of patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis, 73/149 (49%; 41% to 57%) were positive for HIV; 67/83 (81%; 70% to 89%) patients with pleural disease and 16/19 (84%; 60% to 97%) patients with pericardial disease were positive.
 HIV positive patients with positive sputum culture were less likely to have had a positive sputum smear, and their chest x ray films less often showed classic upper zone disease or cavitation.
 Of 72 patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for AIDS, 17 were negative for HIV.
 CONCLUSIONS--The high prevalence of HIV in patients with tuberculosis suggests that an epidemic of reactivating tuberculosis is arising in those who are infected with HIV.
 The redirection of public health priorities towards tuberculosis would focus on a major treatable and preventable complication of the AIDS epidemic.

"Airflow obstruction after substance P aerosol: contribution of airway and pulmonary edema.
 We have studied the effects of aerosolized substance P (SP) in guinea pigs with reference to lung resistance and dynamic compliance changes and their recovery after hyperinflation.
 In addition, we have examined the concomitant formation of airway microvascular leakage and lung edema.
 Increasing breaths of SP (1.5 mg/ml, 1.1 mM), methacholine (0.15 mg/ml, 0.76 mM), or 0.9% saline were administered to tracheostomized and mechanically ventilated guinea pigs.
 Lung resistance (RL) increased dose dependently with a maximum effect of 963 +/- 85% of baseline values (mean +/- SE) after SP (60 breaths) and 1,388 +/- 357% after methacholine (60 breaths).
 After repeated hyperinflations, methacholine-treated animals returned to baseline, but after SP, mean RL was still raised (292 +/- 37%; P less than 0.005).
 Airway microvascular leakage, measured by extravasation of Evans Blue dye, occurred in the brain bronchi and intrapulmonary airways after SP but not after methacholine.
 There was a significant correlation between RL after hyperinflation and Evans Blue dye extravasation in intrapulmonary airways (distal: r = 0.89, P less than 0.005; proximal: r = 0.85, P less than 0.01).
 Examination of frozen sections for peribronchial and perivascular cuffs of edema and for alveolar flooding showed significant degrees of pulmonary edema for animals treated with SP compared with those treated with methacholine or saline.
 We conclude that the inability of hyperinflation to fully reverse changes in RL after SP may be due to the formation of both airway and pulmonary edema, which may also contribute to the deterioration in RL.

"Surfactant replacement therapy in respiratory distress syndrome. Meta-analysis of clinical trials of single-dose surfactant extracts.
 Replacement therapy with surfactant extracts in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in several clinical trials.
 The results of individual trials do not provide conclusive evidence that administration of a single dose of surfactant improves morbidity or mortality.
 Meta-analysis is a statistical method to combine the results of such clinical trials, and combined analysis provides a means to overcome the problem of not being able to detect significant small differences in individual trials due to these small sample sizes.
 Seven clinical trials (277 patients treated with nonhuman surfactant extract and 263 controls) met the criteria for analysis; five outcome measurements (mortality, patent ductus arteriosus, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) were selected to estimate the treatment effect.
 The meta-analysis showed that a single dose of surfactant administered before the first breath or within 15 hours of birth significantly decreased the mortality rate (95% confidence interval = -0.19 to -0.03) and the risk of developing pneumothorax (95% confidence interval = -0.28 to 0.14) in infants with respiratory distress syndrome.
 Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate other aspects of surfactant replacement therapy in premature infants because inconsistent results were observed among the seven analyzed studies.

 The purpose of this Phase II pilot study was to determine whether a dose-intensive regimen of weekly cisplatin combined with other active non-cross-resistant agents would improve the response rate and survival time of patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer.
 Patients received cisplatin (50 mg/m2/wk) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 36, 43, 50, and 57 combined with mitomycin C (8 mg/m2) on days 1 and 36, vinblastine (3 mg/m2) on days 8 and 43, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (1 g/m2) by continuous infusion over 24 hours on days 15 and 50.
 Responding patients received consolidation therapy with cisplatin and etoposide (VP-16).
 Of 82 registered patients, 80 were eligible and 77 were evaluable for response.
 The overall response rate was 23% with 1 patient achieving a complete response (CR) and 17 patients achieving a partial response (PR).
 The median survival time was 4.6 months.
 The toxicity profile was not different from that described for standard-dose regimens.
 Although this regimen does not offer any benefit over standard-dose cisplatin regimens for patients with extensive non-small lung cancer, the weekly schedule permits a dose-intensive regimen with acceptable toxicity for tumors that may benefit from this approach.

"Effect of fasting on the lung glutathione redox cycle in air- and oxygen-exposed mice: beneficial effects of sugar.
 Fasting increases susceptibility to hyperoxic lung damage in mice, at least in part, by decreasing lung glutathione level.
 To determine whether fasting alters other components of the glutathione redox cycle, and whether a diet of sugar alone reverses fasting's effects, normally fed, sugar-fed, and fasted mice were exposed to room air or 100% oxygen for up to 4 days.
 In air-exposed mice, fasting decreased glutathione peroxidase (GP) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities 15% to 20% on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.01) and glutathione level 25% to 30% on days 2 to 4 (p less than 0.05).
 When corrected for protein concentration, GP and GR values were similar to those in the fed mice, but glutathione levels remained lower on days 2 and 3 (p less than 0.05).
 Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was unchanged, but the ratio of GSSG to total glutathione (reduced glutathione plus GSSG) increased on day 2 (p less than 0.05).
 In oxygen-exposed fed mice, GP increased 62% and GR increased 39% on day 4 (p less than 0.05), the time when the lung injury was most severe; glutathione increased 30% on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05); and GSSG increased threefold and eightfold on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.01).
 Oxygen-exposed fasted mice were all dead by day 3 (versus no deaths in the fed mice), failed to increase GR and total glutathione in response to the oxidant stress, and increased GP and GSSG on day 3 to the same extent as the fed mice did on day 4.

 We performed percutaneous balloon pericardial window (PBPW) in 8 patients (age 40 to 70 yrs; 4 men, 4 women) with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade.
 Pericardial window was indicated because they continued to drain greater than 100 ml/day of pericardial fluid through the pigtail catheter for greater than or equal to 3 days.
 A 0.038 inch guidewire was advanced through the pigtail catheter into the pericardial space and then the catheter was removed.
 A 20 mm diameter, 3 cm long balloon dilating catheter was advanced to straddle the parietal pericardium.
 Manual inflations were performed until the waist produced by the pericardium disappeared.
 All patients tolerated the procedure well with minimal discomfort and with no complications.
 A left or bilateral pleural effusion occurred in all patients after PBPW.
 No patient developed recurrent pericardial tamponade at a mean follow-up of 6 +/- 2 months.
 Thus, PBPW is a useful and safe technique to avoid surgery in patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade.

"Serum-erythropoietin concentration during acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
 Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO).
 There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia.
 The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE).
 In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours.
 At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL).
 Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal.
 The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period.
 The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes.
 Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely.
 The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism.

 A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of immunotherapy was conducted in patients with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus rhinitis.
 Thirty patients received an extract with a high content of Der p I (Pharmalgen), 20 received a conventional mite extract (Allpyral), and 30 patients received histamine chloride (placebo).
 Specific IgG and subclasses were measured before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment by RIA and/or ELISA, and specific IgE by RAST.
 Clinical outcome was assessed by skin prick tests, nasal challenge, visual analogue, and diary-card symptom and drug scores; from these findings, a clinical index was derived.
 An IgG response occurred only in the Pharmalgen-treated group: D.
 pter IgG and IgG1 increased by 3 months (p less than 0.05) and then plateaued to 12 months (p less than 0.05).
 IgG4 levels increased throughout treatment (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01), as did the IgG/IgE ratio.
 A subclass switch from IgG1 to IgG4 occurred.

 Pretreatment levels of IgE, IgG1, or IgG4 did not predict clinical outcome.
 Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that IgG subclasses may modulate antigen-IgE interactions, although the antibody response to this potent extract need not be causally related to improvement.

 Selective decontamination of the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract with nonabsorbable antimicrobials and sucralfate, a stress ulcer prophylactic that maintains the normal gastric acid bacterial barrier, were compared for prevention of pneumonia in a cardiac surgery intensive care unit.
 Over 8 months, 51 patients received selective decontamination and 56 received sucralfate.
 The selective decontamination regimen included polymyxin, gentamicin, and nystatin given as an oral paste and as a solution; patients also received standard antacid or histamine2 blocker stress ulcer prophylaxis.
 Patients in the selective decontamination group had significantly less colonization of the oropharynx and stomach by gram-negative bacilli (12% vs.

 Autologous washed red blood cells were injected weekly over a period of three to six months into the cisterna magna of adult New Zealand white rabbits.
 After three months, the surface of the brain stem, cerebellum, and piriform cortex showed a distinct brown color, and staining of the gross specimens for iron produced an intense blue color which extended for a distance of 1-2 mm into the brain parenchyma.
 Enhanced iron stains of vibratome sections revealed the accumulation of reaction product in microglia and Bergmann glia of the cerebellar cortex, and in microglia and astrocytes of the piriform cortex.
 Ferritin immunocytochemistry revealed reaction product in cerebellar microglia and Bergmann glia which strongly resembled that obtained by the enhanced iron stain.
 In the piriform cortex, only microglia were reactive with anti-ferritin.
 Electron microscopy confirmed the accumulation of electron-dense ferritin granules only in the cytoplasm of microglia.
 Bergmann glia in the cerebellum and astrocytic processes in the piriform cortex were replete with intermediate filaments and contained an excess of glycogen.
 After six months, small granules of hemosiderin began to appear in cerebellar and piriform cortices.
 The observations support that the sequence of conversion of hemoglobin to ferritin and hemosiderin occurs in brain as in other organs.

"Pulmonary arteriolar muscularization in coal workers' pneumoconiosis and its correlation with right ventricular hypertrophy.
 The relationship between the thickness of the walls of small pulmonary arteries (the medial wall thickness as a percentage of external diameter, percentage of medial thickness) in coal miners and control subjects were studied using morphometric techniques and correlated with the degree of right ventricular hypertrophy, severity of coal workers' pneumoconiosis, emphysema, and other chronic lung diseases.
 Pulmonary arteries less than 100 microns in external diameter were identified and the external diameter, medial thickness, and intimal thickness were quantitatively measured in the lung tissues of 57 coal miners and 15 control subjects with and without other chronic lung diseases.
 Coal workers' pneumoconiosis, emphysema, and right ventricular hypertrophy were assessed uniformly in all cases.
 The arterial wall thickness correlated with right ventricular hypertrophy, progressive massive fibrosis, and other chronic lung diseases.
 Severity of emphysema also showed a weak correlation.
 Although the functional significance of these findings is not known, we conclude that the muscularization of pulmonary arterioles provides a structural basis for the development of right ventricular hypertrophy in coal miners.

"Mechanism of cytolytic T lymphocyte killing of a low class I-expressing tumor.
 Many tumors have been shown to express minimal levels of class I MHC Ag, which makes them more resistant to recognition and lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes.
 Line 1, a BALB/c spontaneous lung carcinoma, normally expresses very low levels of class I Ag, but expression can be increased 50-fold by treatment with agents such as DMSO or IFN-gamma.
 Because class I Ag serve as restricting elements for cytolytic T cell recognition of tumor Ag, we wished to determine if cytotoxic T lymphocytes could play a role in the immune response to this type of class I low, but inducible, tumor.
 After immunization in vivo and restimulation of splenic cells in vitro we were able to generate T cell clones that lysed line 1 cells induced to express high levels of class I, but did not lyse uninduced, low class I expressing line 1 cells in short term (6-h) 51Cr release assays.
 Paradoxically, incubation of the T cells with uninduced class I low line 1 cells for a few days resulted in complete destruction of the tumor cells.
 We demonstrate that the T cells, stimulated by the tumor cells, produce IFN-gamma, which in turn induces class I expression on the line 1 cells making them susceptible to lysis by the T cell clone.
 This suggests that a positive feedback reaction can occur in generating a response to this and perhaps other inducible tumor cell lines.

"Theophylline in asthma and COPD: changing perspectives and controversies.
 Theophylline's role in the treatment of airway obstruction has been challenged, yet it remains a useful agent in the management of obstructive lung disease.
 It has a narrow therapeutic range and frequent side effects.
 Drug interactions are common, and variations in theophylline clearance among patients arise from individual differences in its absorption, metabolism, and elimination.
 Acute bronchospasm is best treated with inhaled sympathomimetic agents, but the nonbronchodilator effects of theophylline offer therapeutic benefits for the patient with non-reversible disease.
 When properly monitored by serum level determinations, theophylline may be used as an adjunct to aerosol therapy and corticosteroids in asthma.
 However, the patient with COPD may benefit the most from an empiric trial of the drug, using lower doses than were commonly employed in the past.

 Sixty-three primary lung carcinomas, 31 metastatic adenocarcinomas (ACs) (from breast, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary tract), and 36 MMs were immunostained with 44-3A6, Leu-M1, and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
 The results confirm the value of 44-3A6 in identifying ACs but do not allow distinction between those of pulmonary, breast, GIT, or ovarian mucinous derivation.
 Endometrial, ovarian serous, and renal ACs are essentially nonreactive, as are almost all MMs.
 The occurrence of one positive MM predicates caution in interpreting 44-3A6 positivity in isolation, but, judiciously used with other discriminating antibodies such as Leu-M1 and anti-CEA, 44-3A6 is of value in the differential diagnosis of ACs and MMs.
 Further, its applicability to cytologic specimens may obviate the need for more invasive diagnostic procedures and lead to rapid, accurate diagnosis.

"99mTc-anti-CEA radioimmunoscintigraphy of lung adenocarcinoma.
 Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen radioimmunoscintigraphy (anti-CEA RIS) in colorectal adenocarcinoma has been reported to allow a better estimation of the local tumor extension than other radiologic methods.
 This study evaluated the clinical feasibility of a 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431/26, Behring Institute, FRG) in 11 patients for staging of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.
 The primary tumor size ranged from 3 to 8 cm with a mean of 4 cm.
 Mediastinal and hilar nodes were present in four patients, intrapulmonary metastases were present in two patients, and pleural and liver metastases were present in one patient each.
 The CEA levels were in the range of 2 to 265 ng/ml and elevated (greater than 5 ng/ml) in six patients.
 Planar scintigraphy was performed at 6 h and 24 h post injection (pi).
 Analog and digitized images were interpreted by two observers.
 One patient was imaged twice and experienced serum sickness due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after the second study, which showed marked unspecific tracer uptake in liver, spleen, and bone marrow, but no specific uptake by the tumor and was excluded from further analysis.
 Visual interpretation identified the primary tumor clearly in seven patients.
 No tumor imaging was observed in two patients.
 Two patients were classified as having questionable imaging due to a poor separation of tumor uptake from mediastinal blood pool.
 The primary tumor could be clearly delineated in both patients after comparison with the chest radiograph.
 Thus, the overall sensitivity for imaging of the primary tumor was 82 percent.
 The average target/background ratio was 1.31 +/- 0.17:1 at 6 h pi, and 1.30 +/- 0.16:1 at 24 h pi.
 Hilar and mediastinal nodes were correctly suspected in three patients, but the cardiac blood pool hampered a clear interpretation.
 Intrapulmonary and pleural metastases were diagnosed in all cases.
 The single liver metastasis was missed because of the high unspecific tracer uptake.
 Planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 was superior to computed tomography (CT) in one case with subtotal tumor resection.
 We summarize that at present, planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 cannot be advised as a routine staging procedure in adenocarcinoma of the lung, but it may be helpful in the detection of residual or recurrent tumor tissue.

"Factors affecting perioperative pulmonary function in acute respiratory failure.
 To determine the magnitude, duration, and associated factors of perioperative changes in pulmonary function, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 145 patients who required preoperative mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure before undergoing 200 surgical procedures.
 Patients were grouped into five pulmonary diagnostic categories: (1) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 49); (2) pneumonia (n = 20); (3) atelectasis (n = 65); (4) congestive heart failure (n = 11); and (5) acute ventilatory failure (n = 55).
 Sixty patients underwent intra-abdominal surgery, 135 patients required surgery on the periphery, and five patients had a thoracotomy.
 For all patients, PaO2/FIO2 declined significantly from 321 mm Hg (mean) preoperatively to 258 mm Hg intraoperatively, and shunt fraction (Qs/QT) increased from 0.16 to 0.23 without a significant change in PaCO2.
 The magnitude of the increase in Qs/QT did not differ among pulmonary diagnostic groups.
 Preoperatively, patients undergoing laparotomy had lower PaO2/FIO2 (278 vs 340) and higher Qs/QT (0.19 vs 0.14) than patients requiring surgery on the periphery.
 Intraoperatively, Qs/QT increased more during abdominal procedures than during peripheral procedures.
 Intraoperative hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 less than 80 mm Hg) occurred during 13 procedures.
 Hypoxemic patients had a mean increase in Qs/QT of 0.20 (0.25 preoperatively to 0.45 intraoperatively), and a significant increase in PaCO2 from 38 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg intraoperatively).
 In general, these patients had ARDS (n = 10), sepsis (n = 10), a laparotomy (n = 9), and intraoperative mechanical ventilation via the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator (n = 8), a commonly used operating room ventilator.
 Their preoperative peak airway pressure (54 cm H2O) and minute ventilation (20 L/min) requirements exceeded the capabilities of the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator and likely contributed to impaired gas exchange intraoperatively.
 Within the first several hours postoperatively, PaO2/FIO2 recovered to preoperative levels in all patients, even in those who had severe intraoperative hypoxemia develop and who underwent laparotomy.
 We conclude that most patients with acute respiratory failure receiving preoperative mechanical ventilation experienced mild-to-moderate deterioration in intraoperative pulmonary oxygen exchange that rapidly returned to preoperative levels after surgery.
 We recommend that necessary surgery not be postponed by concern that pulmonary function will be worsened by surgery and anesthesia.

"The management of flail chest injury: factors affecting outcome.
 The records of 57 patients presenting with flail chest injury from 1981 through 1987 were reviewed to determine factors affecting morbidity and mortality.
 Fifteen patients (26%) had 8+ rib fractures with a unilateral flail and seven (12%) had multiple rib fractures with a bilateral flail.
 Thirty-two (56%) had moderate-severe pulmonary contusions and 44 (77%) required chest tubes for hemo-pneumothorax.
 Ventilatory assistance was used in 36 (63%).
 The major factors determining the need for ventilatory assistance were: an ISS greater than or equal to 23, blood transfusions in the first 24 hours, moderate-severe associated injuries (fractures, head injuries or truncal organs requiring operation), and shock on admission (p less than 0.001).
 An adverse outcome occurred in 15 (28%); nine required ventilatory assistance greater than or equal to 14 days and six died of sepsis with pneumonia.
 The main factors associated with an adverse outcome were: an ISS greater than or equal to 31 (p less than 0.001), moderate-severe associated injuries (p less than 0.001), and blood transfusions (p less than 0.005).
 Although the primary determinants of an adverse outcome were the associated injuries and blood loss, a bilateral flail (p less than 0.01) and age greater than or equal to 50 years (p less than 0.02) were contributing factors.

"A randomized controlled trial of a reduced daily dose of zidovudine in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group.
 BACKGROUND.
 The initially tested dose of zidovudine for the treatment of patients with advanced disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) was 1500 mg.
 Although this dose is effective, it is associated with substantial toxicity.
 METHODS.
 To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a reduced dose, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in 524 subjects who had had a first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 The subjects were assigned to receive zidovudine in either a dose of 250 mg taken orally every four hours (the standard-treatment group, n = 262) or a dose of 200 mg taken orally every four hours for four weeks and thereafter 100 mg taken every four hours (the low-dose group, n = 262).
 RESULTS.
 The median length of follow-up was 25.6 months.
 At 18 months the estimated survival rates were 52 percent for the standard-treatment group and 63 percent for the low-dose group (P = 0.012 by the log-rank test).
 At 24 months the estimated survival rates were 27 percent for the standard-treatment group and 34 percent for the low-dose group (P = 0.033).
 In both groups, 82 percent of the subjects had another opportunistic infection, and the length of time to that infection was similar in the two groups (P = 0.56 by the log-rank test).
 CD4 T-lymphocyte counts improved transiently in both groups, and serum levels of HIV antigen decreased in the subjects with antigenemia.
 The hemoglobin level declined to less than 5 mmol per liter (80 g per liter) in 101 subjects in the standard-treatment group and in 77 in the low-dose group (39 vs.
 29 percent, P = 0.0009 by the log-rank test).
 The neutrophil count declined to less than 0.750 x 10(9) per liter in 134 subjects in the standard-treatment group and in 96 in the low-dose group (51 vs.
 37 percent, P = 0.0001).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The reduced daily dose of zidovudine used in this study was at least as effective as the standard dose and was less toxic; however, with the use of a four-week induction period with a high dose followed by low-dose treatment, severe anemia and neutropenia were common complications of treatment with zidovudine.

 Bacterial tracheitis is an uncommon cause of acute respiratory distress in children.
 The authors present a case of bacterial tracheitis in a 6-year-old girl caused by an unusual pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 Her clinical presentation and radiographic findings are typical for an older child.
 Management of this case involved endotracheal intubation, although a review of the literature suggests that airway management can vary with age and size of the tracheal lumen.
 The microbiology of bacterial tracheitis shows a predominance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus reported previously, with only three prior reported cases of Pneumococcus.

"Fatal pulmonary embolism caused by streptokinase treatment of deep venous thrombosis of the leg?
 During the last 10 years, four of 150 (2.7%) patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) treated with streptokinase (SK) at our department have died of pulmonary embolism (PE).
 A retrospective study of 1393 DVT patients treated with heparin during the period 1973-1986 showed that five (0.36%) of these patients died of PE while still on heparin.
 In this paper we describe the four patients treated with SK who developed fatal PE.
 In our opinion this increase in mortality does not warrant the use of SK in routine treatment of DVT of the leg before a proper trial has been conducted to compare the frequencies of pulmonary embolism after both treatments.

"Respiratory health and PM10 pollution. A daily time series analysis.
 This study evaluated changes in respiratory health associated with daily changes in fine particulate pollution (PM10).
 Participants included a relatively healthy school-based sample of fourth and fifth grade elementary students, and a sample of patients with asthma 8 to 72 yr of age.
 Elevated PM10 pollution levels of 150 micrograms/m3 were associated with an approximately 3 to 6% decline in lung function as measured by peak expiratory flow (PEF).
 Current day and daily lagged associations between PM10 levels and PEF were observed.
 Elevated levels of PM10 pollution also were associated with increases in reported symptoms of respiratory disease and use of asthma medication.
 Associations between compromised respiratory health and elevated PM10 pollution were observed even when PM10 levels were well below the 24-h national ambient air quality standard of 150 micrograms/m3.
 Associations between elevated PM10 levels, reductions in PEF, and increases in symptoms of respiratory disease and asthma medication use remained statistically significant even when the only pollution episode that exceeded the standard was excluded.
 Concurrent measurements indicated that little or no strong particle acidity was present.

"Surgical management of tracheal stenosis in an infant with multiple congenital anomalies: when is baby inoperable?
 Congenital tracheal stenosis is a rare disorder that carries a significant morbidity and mortality.
 It is an even greater challenge when present in combination with other life-threatening congenital anomalies.
 We present an infant with multiple congenital anomalies, including trisomy 21, who was diagnosed with congenital tracheal stenosis at 3 months of age.
 At age 5 months, the infant underwent tracheoplasty with costal cartilage graft and pulmonary artery banding.
 Bronchoscopy 3 weeks later revealed a patent airway.
 However, the patient died 2 months postoperatively of cardiac complications.
 At autopsy, whole organ and histologic specimens revealed excellent incorporation of the graft with no evidence of re-stenosis.
 Our documentation of graft incorporation in this patient is evidence that long segments of stenotic trachea can be successfully treated by tracheoplasty utilizing rib cartilage grafts.

"A prospective study of respiratory failure after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta.
 From June 1960 to September 1990, 1414 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 112 (8%) had pulmonary complications requiring respiratory support with tracheostomy; subsequently 45 (40%) died in the hospital.
 We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation.
 In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers.
 Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035).
 In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%).
 On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy.
 The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications.
 In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030).
 These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation.

"Risk stratification of ambulatory patients suspected of Pneumocystis pneumonia.
 To determine whether aspects of clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory studies improve the diagnostic accuracy of the chest roentgenogram in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), we followed up 302 consecutive patients with respiratory symptoms and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus.
 Of the 279 patients (92%) with follow-up information available, 31 (11%) were diagnosed with PCP.
 Only 68% of patients with PCP had typical chest roentgenograms.
 Regression analysis identified four independent predictors of PCP: diffuse or perihilar infiltrates, presence of mouth lesions, lactate dehydrogenase level more than 220 U/L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm/h or more.
 Using these four predictors, patients could be stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for PCP.
 We suggest that examination of the mouth, chest roentgenogram, lactate dehydrogenase level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate be part of the evaluation of ambulatory patients with respiratory symptoms at risk for human immunodeficiency virus.

"Pneumococcal anticapsular antibodies in patients with chronic cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands.
 Differences in pneumococcal anticapsular antibody concentrations were assessed among patients with various chronic disorders and among young (25-35 years of age) and older adults (55-65 years).
 Antibody concentrations were determined by ELISA, using the whole 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine as antigen.
 No differences in mean or distribution of serum antibody concentrations were found among young adults (either healthy or asthmatic) or among older adults (healthy or with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease).
 Each group included individuals with low antibody levels.
 Therefore, the enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal infections reported for some groups at risk, that is, elderly individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease, cannot be attributed solely to low anticapsular antibody concentrations.

 Participants were assessed prior to beginning the program and at the end of 30 days.
 Assessments at both times included physiologic functioning (bicycle ergometry testing, pulmonary function tests, 12-min walk), psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, perceived well-being) and an abbreviated neuropsychological test battery.
 Results indicate significant improvement in physical endurance and pulmonary function, significant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improvement in measures of general well-being and neuropsychological functioning.

 The presence of the soluble form of the interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) was evaluated in the serum of 21 patients with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and 37 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (non-SCLC) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
 The sIL-2R level was measured serially in patients with SCLC both during and after therapy.
 The mean serum level of sIL-2R in patients with SCLC was 3.8 times higher than that of 47 healthy controls and was 1.9 times higher than in 37 patients with non-SCLC.
 Six patients with SCLC had very high levels of sIL-2R, ranging from five to 52 times the mean level observed in normal controls.
 Tumor cells in the pleural fluid of the patient with highest levels were positive with monoclonal antibodies to IL-2R (CD25), NKH-1, OKDR, and OKT9.
 A longitudinal study in this patient showed a good correlation between tumor activity and sIL-2R levels.
 Also, the sIL-2R levels decreased in patients responding to therapy.
 These results suggest that some SCLCs secrete sIL-2R and that the serial measurements of the serum sIL-2R levels can be used as a noninvasive tumor marker in this disease.

"Functional character and augmentation of lymphocytes in regional lymph nodes of patients with lung cancer.
 It appears that lymph node metastases are more frequent in lung cancer than in other cancers because of impaired defensive mechanisms in the regional lymph nodes.
 However, little is known about the immunologic function of regional lymph node lymphocytes (RLNL) in patients with lung cancer.
 We have studied the immunologic properties of RLNL in comparison with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).
 We measured the natural killer (NK) cell activity of RLNL and PBL in patients with lung cancer and found that the NK activity was significantly more depressed in the RLNL than in the PBL.
 In contrast, interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was markedly higher in the RLNL than in the PBL.
 The cytotoxic effect of RLNL in nonmetastatic lymph nodes on target cells (such as K562 cells) or PC-3 and PC-10 cells (NK-resistant, human lung cancer of adenocarcinoma and epidermoid carcinoma, respectively) was significantly enhanced by in vitro incubation with recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2).
 Furthermore, we clarified that both rIL-2 and OK-432, which is a biologic response modifier and IL-2 inducer as well, augmented the cytotoxicity of RLNL and that these effector cells were lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells.
 The depletion of lymphocyte subsets by pretreatment with specific monoclonal antibody showed that the LAK activity in RLNL was mediated by CD3+ and CD8+ cells, whereas the lymphocyte subsets contributing the LAK activity in PBL were CD3+ and CD16+ cells.
 It was concluded that a majority of the effector cells in RLNL were LAK cells of the cytotoxic T cell population.

 Mast cell activation in the lung was investigated by measuring concentrations of mast cell tryptase and histamine in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with bronchial carcinoma, sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and from normal subjects.
 2.
 Histamine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid supernatants were elevated in the bronchial carcinoma and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis groups, and were correlated with the histamine content of the cells recovered.
 3.
 An avidin-biotin-enhanced antigen-capture e.l.i.s.a., using polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for tryptase, and mouse monoclonal antibody AA5, allowed the quantification of tryptase in all samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
 Tryptase concentrations were increased in the bronchial carcinoma and extrinsic allergic alveolitis groups and in some of the patients with sarcoidosis, and the levels correlated with mast cell numbers and also with concentrations of albumin.
 4.
 There was no significant correlation between levels of tryptase and histamine, suggesting differences in the rates of metabolism or different cellular sources.
 5.
 The tryptase and histamine concentrations measured suggest that there is continuous degranulation of mast cells within the normal lung, but that this process is more pronounced in patients with bronchial carcinoma or interstitial lung disease.

"Effects of ligation and embolization on Kf and multiple tracer measurements in dog lungs.
 In isolated blood-perfused dog lungs, the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) and the permeability-surface area product of urea (PS) were measured to determine their responses to two different methods of altering filtration area: lobe ligation (LL, n = 5) and glass bead embolization (GBE, n = 4) during constant perfusion rates (700 +/- 45 ml/min).
 When two of three lobes were ligated, Kf decreased (1.36 +/- 0.13 to 0.58 +/- 0.23 g.min-1.cmH2O-1; P less than 0.05), but PS did not change (2.02 +/- 0.4 to 1.71 +/- 0.3 ml/s).
 Kf per gram of perfused blood-free dry lung weight was unchanged by LL (0.051 +/- 0.17 to 0.052 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1), indicating that surface area per gram measured by Kf remained the same.
 However, PS per gram dry lung doubled (0.07 +/- 0.016 to 0.146 +/- 0.06 ml/s; P less than 0.05) after LL, suggesting that recruitment occurred in the remaining lobe.
 When three lobes were embolized with 200-microns glass beads (0.48 +/- 0.01 g beads/kg body wt), PS decreased (2.1 +/- 0.22 to 0.94 +/- 0.09 ml/s; P less than 0.05), but Kf was not altered (1.01 +/- 0.17 to 1.04 +/- 0.18 g.min-1.cmH2O-1).
 The constancy of Kf after GBE implies that the vascular pressure increase during the Kf measurement was transmitted to both blocked and flowing vessels and thereby measured the same filtration area before and after GBE.
 PS decreased significantly after GBE because of a loss of perfused surface area by the beads blocking flow in small arterial vessels.

"Usefulness of noninvasive diagnostic tools for diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with a normal chest radiograph.
 The value of bedside examination and noninvasive tests in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with a normal chest radiograph was investigated.
 Normal chest radiographs were present in 20 of 260 patients (8%) with acute PE and in 113 of 642 (18%) with suspected acute PE, in whom the diagnosis was excluded.
 A partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood less than or equal to 70 mm Hg in a dyspneic patient with a normal chest radiograph was more often seen among patients with PE (9 of 17, 53%) than among patients in whom PE was excluded (18 of 93, 19%; p less than 0.01).
 However, no combinations of blood gases, signs and symptoms were strictly diagnostic.
 High probability ventilation/perfusion scans among patients with a normal chest radiograph were indicative of PE in only 6 of 9 patients (67%).
 Among patients with low-probability ventilation/perfusion scans, 8 of 47 (17%) had PE.
 This study showed that the combination of dyspnea and hypoxia in a patient with a normal chest radiograph is a useful clue to the diagnosis of PE.
 Although intuition suggested that ventilation/perfusion scans would yield better results in patients with a normal chest radiograph, the ability to diagnose PE by ventilation/perfusion scans in this subset of patients was not enhanced, except by a reduction of the percentage of patients with intermediate probability scans.

"Clindamycin vs penicillin for anaerobic lung infections. High rate of penicillin failures associated with penicillin-resistant Bacteroides melaninogenicus.
 Thirty-seven adult patients with anaerobic lung infections (27 lung abscesses and 10 necrotizing pneumonias) were submitted to transthoracic needle-aspiration and/or bronchoscopic specimen brush cultures before therapy and thereafter in all cases considered to be failures.
 Patients were randomly assigned to receive either clindamycin, 600 mg intravenously every 6 hours, or penicillin G, 2 million U every 4 hours for no less than 8 days, until clinical and radiological improvement became apparent.
 Treatment was continued orally with clindamycin, 300 mg every 6 hours, or penicillin V, 750 mg every 6 hours, until completing a minimum of 4 weeks.
 Ten of the 47 anaerobes initially isolated from the lung (nine Bacteroides melaninogenicus and one Bacteroides capillosus) were resistant to penicillin, but none were resistant to clindamycin.
 Five of the nine patients harboring these penicillin-resistant Bacteroides received penicillin, and all failed to respond to therapy.
 Overall, eight of the 18 patients in the penicillin group and one of 19 in the clindamycin group failed to respond to therapy.
 These drugs were equally well tolerated in both groups.
 The presence of penicillin-resistant Bacteroides is a frequent cause of penicillin failure in patients with anaerobic lung infections.
 In this setting, clindamycin appears to be the current therapy of choice for initial treatment.

"Infections in HIV-infected travelers: risks and prevention.
 OBJECTIVE: To review risks for infection and to outline strategies to protect the health of travelers infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 DATA SOURCES: Original reports and summaries of the geographic distribution and frequency of infections as well as of special risks these infections impose on HIV-infected persons.
 The recommendations incorporate guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization.
 STUDY SELECTION: Sources containing the most recent, pertinent information.
 DATA SYNTHESIS: Infections of the gastrointestinal tract are common in all travelers to developing countries and are likely to be more frequent, severe, and difficult to treat in HIV-infected persons.
 Prominent among the respiratory tract infections that pose special risks to HIV-infected travelers are influenza, measles, and fungal infections with geographically focal distributions.
 The most common vector-borne infection, malaria, appears to present relatively little, if any, incremental risk to the HIV-infected traveler.
 Persons with HIV infection respond less vigorously to vaccines and have a higher frequency of adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents.
 Nevertheless, immunizations and chemoprophylaxis can reduce the risk for many travel-related infections.
 Additionally, there are protective measures that travelers can take to minimize exposure to pathogens.
 CONCLUSIONS: By understanding the risks for disease in different destinations, assessing patients' HIV status, counseling patients about travel plans and personal protective measures, appropriately using vaccines and chemoprophylaxis, as well as instituting early treatment of infection, physicians can help HIV-infected patients to preserve their health during travel.

 Compared with heparin, both rtPA regimens induced marked pulmonary thrombolysis.
 During drug infusion, the rate of thrombolysis was increased 2-fold with rtPA15.
 A 2nd canine study investigated the physiologic mechanism of the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure with rtPA.
 The pattern of hemodynamic improvement with rtPA indicated that pulmonary thrombolysis predominantly occurred in partially, rather than totally, obstructed vascular units.
 A 3rd canine study compared rtPA and high-dose urokinase (UK) in treatment of pulmonary embolism.
 Both rtPA regimens were superior to UK in inducing pulmonary thrombolysis and improving pulmonary hemodynamics.
 Most recently, the effects of flow dynamics on rtPA-induced pulmonary thrombolysis were investigated, and it was demonstrated that an increase in cardiac output markedly enhanced rtPA-induced pulmonary thrombolysis.
 Most likely, the increase in cardiac output increased thrombolysis by enhancing delivery of rtPA to thrombus in partially obstructed vascular units.

"Diffusing capacity of the lung and nifedipine in systemic sclerosis.
 Lung involvement in systemic sclerosis may be due in part to a functional abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature.
 To investigate the possible role of a pulmonary vasospastic process in this disorder, 21 non-smoking patients who had no evidence of cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension were evaluated with pulmonary function tests prior to administration of nifedipine, 30 minutes after a single oral dose of nifedipine (20 mg), and after 4 weeks of treatment with nifedipine (10 mg 3 times daily).
 Treatment with nifedipine did not significantly change any of the pulmonary function values, except for the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO).
 The linear trend between the individual DLCO values at baseline and their changes immediately following the initial 20-mg dose of nifedipine (r = -0.603, P = 0.02) and after 4 weeks of treatment (r = -0.636, P = 0.01) showed that the lower the DLCO value at baseline, the greater the improvement caused by nifedipine.
 These findings support the hypothesis of a potentially reversible pulmonary vasospasm in systemic sclerosis and suggest that nifedipine may be useful in the treatment of lung disease in these patients; however, further studies are needed.

"Randomized trial of salbutamol in acute bronchiolitis.
 To test whether nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) is safe and efficacious for the treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis, we enrolled 83 children (median age 6 months, range 1 to 21 months) in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
 Participants received two treatments at 30-minute intervals of either nebulized salbutamol (0.10 mg/kg in 2 ml 0.9% saline solution) or a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution placebo.
 Outcome measures were the respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and a clinical score based on the degree of wheezing and retractions.
 Patients in the salbutamol arm had significantly greater improvement in clinical scores after the initial treatment (p = 0.04).
 There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03).
 We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis.

"Effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
 To determine the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, we undertook a retrospective review of 31 infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated at Children's National Medical Center.
 Infants were categorized by means of the Bohn quadrant analysis to determine the impact of ECMO on infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and a ""poor prognosis."" All infants assigned to the Bohn 100% mortality quadrant required ECMO.
 The survival rate in this group was 86% (6/7) when assessed preoperatively and 67% (6/9) when assessed postoperatively.
 Comparison of the change occurring in ventilation index and arterial carbon dioxide pressure demonstrated that after repair the clinical condition of 48% of infants deteriorated, 40% improved, and 12% remained unchanged.
 Of the 12 infants whose condition was worse after surgery, 11 eventually required ECMO.
 Our review demonstrates that ECMO improved survival significantly in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who had a ""poor prognosis"" by the criteria of Bohn et al.
 We recommend consideration of ECMO for all infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia for whom maximal medical therapy has failed.

"Widespread dissemination of Pneumocystis carinii infection in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome receiving long-term treatment with aerosolized pentamidine.
 Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) may be infected with many opportunistic pathogens, the most common of which is Pneumocystis carinii.
 P.
 carinii infection typically presents as a subacute pneumonia.
 However, rare cases of localized, extrapulmonary, and disseminated disease have been described.
 Standard therapy for P.
 carinii is systemically administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine.
 These agents, however, frequently are associated with serious adverse effects.
 More recently, aerosolized pentamidine has been proposed as an alternative treatment for those who cannot tolerate standard therapy and as primary and secondary prophylaxis.
 Inhaled pentamidine is effective, but it is not without hazards.
 The authors describe a patient with AIDS who received long-term treatment with aerosolized pentamidine and yet died as a result of widely disseminated P.

"Radiographically occult endobronchial obstruction in bronchogenic carcinoma.
 PURPOSE: While central endobronchial tumors may become radiographically detectable when they cause significant endobronchial obstruction, the incidence of radiographically undetectable obstruction is not known.
 This study prospectively examined the incidence of radiographically undetectable completely obstructing lesions encountered during routine diagnostic bronchoscopy.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for bronchoscopy at the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center because of suspected bronchogenic carcinoma formed the population base.
 Chest radiographs were interpreted routinely 24 hours prior to bronchoscopy.
 Patients found to have complete endobronchial obstruction during bronchoscopy were included in the analysis.
 RESULTS: Eighty-one completely obstructing lesions were found in 77 patients.
 No radiographic signs of obstruction were found in 36 (44%) completely obstructing endobronchial lesions.
 There was no difference in the rate of radiographically occult tumors based on cell type.
 Obstruction of segmental bronchi was more likely to be undetectable than obstruction of more proximal airways.
 Chest radiographs were normal in 13 (16%).
 All 13 had risk factors for and symptoms suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma.
 CONCLUSION: Complete endobronchial obstruction due to bronchogenic carcinoma can occur frequently in patients at risk for lung cancer.
 The significant incidence of radiographically undetectable complete obstruction has implications for the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment of lung cancer.

"Role of flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related pulmonary disease.
 Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 16 pediatric patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and deterioration in pulmonary function suggestive of opportunistic infection.
 In 62% of the patients Pneumocystis carinii was identified.
 Culture results showed a pure growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for one patient in addition to the Pneumocystis carinii.
 Bronchoscopy with lavage was well tolerated, with few complications even among patients with significant tachypnea and hypoxia.
 Because of its relative safety and effectiveness, this procedure should be considered the first invasive measurement used for evaluation of parenchymal lung disease in this population of patients.

"Deaths in adults with notified pulmonary tuberculosis 1983-5.
 For a study of fatality in pulmonary tuberculosis in England and Wales, a sample (n = 1222) of patients notified in 1983 as having tuberculosis confined to the lungs was selected and their mortality up to the time of finishing chemotherapy calculated.
 During that time 158 patients died, a case fatality of 12.9%.
 Stratification by age and radiographic extent of disease confirmed these as important predictors of death.
 Comparison with a referent population showed that the all cause mortality among people with pulmonary tuberculosis was 10 times greater than that of the age and sex matched general population.
 This ratio fell with increasing age and with extent of disease.
 Coefficients derived from a logistic regression analysis allowed probability of death during chemotherapy of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis to be estimated.

"Lipid peroxidation and expression of copper-zinc and manganese superoxide dismutase in lungs of premature infants with hyaline membrane disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 The putative involvement of reactive oxygen species in the etiology of lung damage in infants receiving mechanical ventilation has been examined by comparing the levels of peroxidation and expression of the antioxidant enzymes, CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase, in lungs from control and affected infants as well as from fetuses and infants who died postnatally after term delivery.
 Mean levels (+/- SD) of lung peroxidation, determined with a thiobarbituric acid method, were similar in affected and control premature neonates and in fetal subjects (1.87 +/- 1.26, 1.92 +/- 2.07, and 1.19 +/- 1.36 nmol/mg protein, respectively).
 Expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases was also similar in these subjects and in the patients who died postnatally.
 Thus activity measurements and immunoblotting studies showed continuous expression of these enzymes throughout development with no apparent change in protein levels or size.
 Immunohistochemical examination of lung tissue showed expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases in epithelial, smooth muscle, endothelial, and some mesenchyme components.
 In patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alveolar walls were thickened by an excess of fibrous tissue and terminal air spaces were lined mainly by type II pneumatocytes.
 All structures, including abnormal fibrous components, were positive for both CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase.
 Our data show that, unlike some experimental animals, expression of at least these antioxidant enzymes in human infants born prematurely is similar to that in adults, and indicate that such infants are better adapted for life in an oxygen-containing environment than previously suspected.

"Nosocomial pneumonia in Medicare patients. Hospital costs and reimbursement patterns under the prospective payment system.
 To determine the extent to which hospitals are reimbursed for Medicare patients who develop nosocomial pneumonia, we analyzed hospital accounting costs, reimbursements received, and the net income from 33 Medicare patients who developed nosocomial pneumonia.
 In 31 of the 33 cases, hospital costs for the entire admission exceeded reimbursements, with a median net loss of $5800 per case.
 Eleven randomly selected pneumonia cases were compared with control patients matched by diagnosis related group, age, sex, and service.
 Cases had significantly longer hospital stays, had greater total hospital costs, and caused greater net losses than did matched controls.
 We conclude that hospitals are seldom reimbursed adequately for Medicare patients who develop nosocomial pneumonia.
 With the advent of the prospective payment system, hospitals now have substantial financial incentives for implementing cost-effective measures for preventing nosocomial pneumonias.

"Verapamil-induced blockade of voltage-activated K+ current in small-cell lung cancer cells.
 Verapamil, Ca++ channel antagonist, has proven clinically useful in the reversal of multiple drug resistance, which is a major detriment to chemotherapy.
 Recently, verapamil alone has been shown to diminish proliferation in a variety of neoplastic cell lines.
 Using the patch-clamp technique, the action of verapamil on voltage-gated K+ channels in two cell lines of human small-cell carcinoma of the lung, NCI-H146 and NCI-H82, was investigated.
 With inward Na+ current suppressed, virtually all control cells exhibited a slowly inactivating outward current that was insensitive to alterations in the external Ca++ concentration.
 Externally applied verapamil enhanced the rate and extent of outward K+ current (IK) inactivation.
 Verapamil at a concentration of 20 microM diminished peak IK, evoked by a test pulse to +60 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV, from 1.38 +/- 0.11 nA (mean +/- S.E.M., n = 29 cells) to 0.56 +/- 0.13 nA (n = 11) and caused IK to decay to less than 20% of the peak current within 60 msec.
 After blocking IK and Na+ current, Ca++ current (ICa) was measured in the presence of 10 mM Ca++.
 The addition of 100 microM verapamil to the external bath resulted in a 53% reduction of H146 ICa.
 Peak ICa fell from 81 +/- 9 pA (n = 22) to 38 +/- 8 pA (n = 12).
 Examination of the whole-cell K+ current on single cells before and immediately after the addition of 100 microM verapamil clearly revealed that the drug had no effect on the initial activation phase of IK, suggesting that K+ channels first open before interacting with the drug.

 Although Haemophilus influenzae is recognized as a major pathogen of infants, its role in maternal and neonatal infections is not as well appreciated.
 We analyzed the records of all mothers and neonates infected with H influenzae over a 10-year period.
 Twenty-eight mother/neonate sets were identified in which at least one had documented infection with H influenzae.
 Of the 18 mothers with documented infection, 13 had chorioamnionitis, endometritis, or both, and two of these mothers were bacteremic with H influenzae.
 Of the 23 infected neonates, 15 presented with early sepsis and/or pneumonia and nine had conjunctivitis.
 During the period of the study, only group B streptococci and Escherichia coli were more common as causes of early neonatal bacteremia.

"Protein concentrations have little effect on reabsorption of fluid from isolated rat lungs.
 A study was conducted to determine whether differences in the concentrations of large molecules between the air space and perfusate solutions altered the rates at which fluid was reabsorbed from isolated fluid-filled perfused rat lungs.
 Four groups of experiments were conducted: 1) 5 g/dl albumin in the air spaces and perfusate, 2) 15 g/dl albumin in the air space and 5 g/dl albumin in the perfusate, 3) 5 g/dl albumin in the air space and 15 g/dl albumin in the perfusate, and 4) a mixture of 5 g/dl albumin and 7 g/dl Dextran 70 in the air spaces and 5 g/dl albumin in the perfusate.
 Fluid reabsorption was determined by following the concentration of albumin labeled with Evans blue (T-1824) in the air space and perfusate compartments.
 Because leakage of protein between the air space and perfusate compartments is very slow, increases in T-1824 concentrations in the air spaces indicated loss of fluid from this compartment, whereas decreases in these concentrations in the perfusate compartment provided evidence of fluid transport into the vasculature.
 Approximately 30% of the air space fluid was reabsorbed in a 2-h period, and virtually all of this fluid reached the perfusate compartment.
 Despite oncotic differences that ranged from -65 to 65 Torr, variations in air space or perfusate albumin concentrations did not have a significant effect on this process.
 A 30% decrease in fluid reabsorption was observed when dextran was in the air space solution, but this decrease did not appear to be due to the oncotic properties of this solution because albumin did not have a measurable effect on reabsorption.

"Eosinophil cationic protein stimulates and major basic protein inhibits airway mucus secretion.
 Possible roles of eosinophil (EO) products in modulating the release of mucus from airway explants were investigated.
 Cell- and membrane-free lysates from purified human EOs (1 to 20 x 10(5)) caused a dose-dependent release of respiratory glycoconjugates (RGC) from cultured feline tracheal explants.
 Crude extracts from isolated EO granules also stimulated RGC release, suggesting that a granular protein might be responsible.
 Three proteins derived from EO granules, EO-derived neurotoxin, EO cationic protein (ECP), and major basic protein (MBP) were separated by sequential sizing and affinity chromatography.
 ECP (0.025 to 25 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-dependent increase in RGC release from both feline and human airway explants and also stimulated the release of the serous cell-marker, lactoferrin, from human bronchial explants.
 EO-derived neurotoxin (0.025 to 50 micrograms/ml) failed to affect RGC release, whereas MBP (50 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited RGC release from feline explants.
 Thus, ECP stimulates RGC and lactoferrin release from airway explants, whereas MBP inhibits RGC release.

"Reduction by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor of fever and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
 BACKGROUND.
 Neutropenia and infection are major dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy.
 Previous studies have suggested that recombinant methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can reduce chemotherapy-related neutropenia in patients with cancer.
 We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test this hypothesis and the clinical implications.
 METHODS.
 Patients with small-cell lung cancer were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl G-CSF to study the incidence of infection as manifested by fever with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 1.0 x 10(9) per liter, with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.2 degrees C) resulting from up to six cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide.
 The patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or G-CSF, with treatment beginning on day 4 and continuing through day 17 of a 21-day cycle.
 RESULTS.
 The safety of the study treatment could be evaluated in 207 of the 211 patients assigned to either drug, and its efficacy in 199.
 At least one episode of fever with neutropenia occurred in 77 percent of the placebo group, as compared with 40 percent of the G-CSF group (P less than 0.001).
 Over all cycles of chemotherapy, the median duration of grade IV neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9) per liter) was six days with placebo as compared with one day with G-CSF.
 During cycles of blinded treatment, the number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, the number of days of hospitalization, and the incidence of confirmed infections were reduced by approximately 50 percent when G-CSF was given, as compared with placebo.
 Mild-to-moderate medullary bone pain occurred in 20 percent of the patients receiving G-CSF.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The use of G-CSF as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with small-cell cancer of the lung was well tolerated and led to reductions in the incidence of fever with neutropenia and culture-confirmed infections; in the incidence, duration, and severity of grade IV neutropenia; and in the total number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics and days of hospitalization.

"Intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator in a regimen of noninvasive ventilatory support 
 The purpose of this work is to present 640 patient-years of experience using the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator (IAPV) in a regimen of noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with paralytic/restrictive respiratory insufficiency.
 Fifty-two of the 54 patients who used the IAPV used 24-hour noninvasive ventilatory support.
 Thirty-eight of the 52 patients could tolerate less than 15 minutes of free time off their ventilators except by the successful use of glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB).
 No patient, however, retained an indwelling tracheostomy and none required or used supplemental oxygen therapy.
 Forty-eight of the 54 patients used the IAPV for daytime support for a mean of 12.9 +/- 11.5 years (3 months to 39 years) while using other forms of noninvasive support overnight.
 All 48 patients maintained normal minute ventilation and end-tidal PCO2 on the IAPV.
 One patient used the IAPV only for nocturnal ventilatory support for six months.
 Five patients relied on the IAPV as their sole method of ventilatory support 24 hours a day for a mean of 13.4 +/- 11.2 years (range, 2 to 31 years).
 Three of these five patients had no free time and were studied by nocturnal SaO2 monitoring that demonstrated a mean SaO2 of 95 percent or greater and a minimum SaO2 of 86 percent.
 The maximum end-tidal PCO2 was 49 mm Hg during sleep on the IAPV.
 The 48 patients receiving daytime IAPV support reported few difficulties.
 However, two of the five patients using the IAPV 24 hours a day had development of sacral decubiti.
 The IAPV became ineffective for 12 patients after 12.3 +/- 9.5 years of use.
 These patients then switched to daytime mouth IPPV.
 We conclude that the IAPV is a safe and effective method of long-term daytime ventilatory support for patients with paralytic/restrictive respiratory insufficiency.
 Its use is optimized when employed in combination with other noninvasive methods of ventilatory support, thus eliminating the need for tracheostomy, and optimizing the use of GPB.
 Regular follow-up is important because the IAPV can become less effective with time.

"Comparative efficacies of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and cefaclor against experimental Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infections in mice.
 Experimental respiratory infections were established in mice by intranasal inoculation of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 Inoculation of 10(7) CFU of either S.
 pneumoniae 1629 or S.
 pneumoniae 7 produced a fatal pneumonia in nontreated mice 2 to 3 days after infection.
 Oral therapy was commenced 1 h after infection and was continued three times a day for 2 days.
 The doses used in mice produced peak concentrations in serum and lung tissue similar to those measured in humans.
 Ciprofloxacin failed to eliminate either strain of pneumococcus from mouse lungs at any of the doses tested (40, 80, or 160 mg/kg of body weight) by the end of therapy (33 h).
 Mice that received ciprofloxacin at 160 mg/kg were clear of S.
 pneumoniae 7 5 days later, whereas persistence and regrowth of S.
 pneumoniae 1629 resulted in the death of 20% of animals treated with ciprofloxacin.
 Therapy with cefaclor (20 mg/kg) produced an effect similar to that of ciprofloxacin.
 In contrast, amoxicillin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (10/5 and 20/10 mg/kg) were significantly (P less than 0.05) more effective in eliminating both strains of S.

"Long-term results after lateral cranial base surgery.
 The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved.

 Neutrophils comprised 55.3 +/- 24.4 percent of recovered cells by BAL in DPB patients but only 6.6 +/- 6.4 percent in chronic bronchitis patients, and 1.8 +/- 1.5 percent in normal control subjects (p less than 0.001, all comparisons).
 The DPB patients also exhibited a decreased percentage of alveolar macrophages (34.9 +/- 23.5 percent) compared with chronic bronchitis patients and normal control subjects (p less than 0.001, all comparisons).
 The percentage of lymphocytes of the recovered lavage cells in DPB patients did not differ from that in chronic bronchitis patients and normal control subjects.
 These results indicate that neutrophils play an important role in the pathogenesis of DPB.
 They also suggest that neutrophilia of BAL-recovered fluid is a common finding in diseases associated with bronchiolar inflammation despite some clinical and pathophysiologic differences.

"Community-based short-course treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in a developing nation. Initial report of an eight-month, largely intermittent regimen in a population with a high prevalence of drug resistance.
 A community-based tuberculosis case-finding and short-course chemotherapy program was conducted in a suburb of Manila and featured 1 month of daily isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA) followed by 7 months of twice-weekly, high dose, directly observed INH + EMB + PZA.
 Church-affiliated lay workers obtained 1,990 sputum specimens from subjects who complained of chronic cough or wasting symptoms; 207 of the specimens were positive on Ziehl-Neelsen smears.
 On culture, 176 yielded a significant growth of M.

 Of these 176 patients, 144 were selected to enter the study; 10 were lost because of withdrawal or death and four (2.7%) because of drug toxicity.
 This left 130 patients who were followed long-term.
 Remarkably, 80% (104) were initially shedding drug-resistant organisms; 26% (34) were resistant to one drug, 30% (40) were resistant to two drugs, and 24% (30) were resistant to three or more drugs.
 Responses to therapy corresponded closely to the extent of drug resistance: 80% (48 of 60) of patients with drug-susceptible or single resistance had a favorable outcome; 43% (28 of 65) were resistant to two or three drugs, and 0% (0 of 5) of those were resistant to four or more drugs.
 Notable findings of this study were the success of a community-based program in conducting prolonged, directly observed treatment, the unexpectedly high prevalence of multiple-drug-resistant organisms in this population, and the inadequacy of INH + PZA + EMB during the continuation phase of therapy in this setting.

"Methionine dependency of malignant tumors: a possible approach for therapy 
 When methionine (Met), an essential amino acid, was substituted for by its precursor homocysteine (Hcy) in the culture medium, normal cells such as fibroblasts proliferated normally.
 In contrast, many tumor cells failed to grow or grew at a lower rate.
 Met dependency is acquired simultaneously with cell transformation, as observed with HBL 100, a human mammary epithelial cell line that acquired increased malignancy as a function of in vitro passage number, and NIH/3T3 (J10), a mouse fibroblast line transformed by transfection with the human HRAS oncogene.
 A relationship was observed between Met dependency and metastatic potential of the RMS-21, RMS-S4T, and RMS-J1 sublines derived from RMS-0, a rat rhabdomyosarcoma cell line: the higher the metastatic potential of the cell line, the higher the concentration of Met required to maintain its proliferation.
 Met-independent cells derived from the RMS-0 line, obtained by a progressive decrease of Met in the culture medium lost their tumorigenicity when injected into rats fed with Met-deprived diets.
 In addition, the in vitro motility of RMS-S4T tumor cells, a marker of metastatic capability, decreased in Met-free Hcy-complemented (Met- Hcy+) medium.
 Similarly, RMS-0 tumor cells, preincubated in a Met- Hcy+ culture medium for 24 hours, evidenced a decreased capacity to form lung colonies when injected into syngeneic rats: the median number of lung colonies was 27 and 3 (P less than .05) for cells cultivated in Met+ Hcy- and Met- Hcy+ media, respectively.
 An amino acid-defined mixture reproducing casein composition was used as a protein source in the diets fed to RMS-J1 tumor-bearing rats.
 Dietary substitution of Hcy for Met (i.e., met deprivation) resulted in decreased tumor growth (from 44.4 +/- 1.0 to 40.6 +/- 1.4; P less than .05) and prevention of metastatic spread (from 37 to 0; P less than .05).
 In conclusion, exogenous Met can be substituted for Hcy to maintain the survival of normal cells but is essential for tumor cell growth in vivo as well as in vitro.
 Therefore, this defect of cancerous versus normal cells could be used for a therapeutic purpose.

"Treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis with intermittent high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide 
 PURPOSE: Concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of daily cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy for the systemic vasculitides have led us to evaluate alternative approaches to treatment in an attempt to achieve comparable efficacy with less toxicity.
 This study sought to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and immunologic effects of glucocorticoids (GC) and intermittent high-dose intravenous CP (""pulse"" CP) in the treatment of 14 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG).
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of active WG was supported by a typical clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis.
 GC treatment was initially provided on a daily basis and later tapered to an alternate-day schedule if vasculitis remained inactive.
 Pulse CP treatment was initially administered once a month for 6 months.
 If after 6 months remission had been attained and GC therapy had been discontinued, then pulse CP treatment was given at less frequent intervals thereafter.
 Treatment and evaluation were provided for participants as inpatients in a clinical research center (National Institutes of Health).
 RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) initially experienced unequivocal improvement with pulse CP therapy, and seven of 14 (50%) achieved remission within 4 months.
 However, treatment was associated with significant toxicity in two patients and later relapses in nine patients, so that a total of 79% either failed to achieve sustained remission or were unable to continue therapy.
 Three of 14 (21%) patients have achieved sustained remissions with the pulse CP protocol and one additional patient (who had a limited exacerbation of WG) continues to receive that therapy after 14 to 22 months (mean 17 months).
 CONCLUSIONS: The use of pulse CP and GC therapy in 14 patients with WG was associated with a high initial response rate.
 However, failure to respond initially to treatment, to sustain improvement, or to tolerate continued treatment was noted in 79% of patients within a period of 1 to 22 months.
 These observations indicate that this particular pulse CP protocol does not achieve a high degree of lasting efficacy.

"Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease.
 Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN).
 In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment.
 The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation.
 It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued.
 Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients.
 Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans.
 All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment.
 Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed.
 The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment.

"Effects of two rescue doses of a synthetic surfactant on mortality rate and survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in 700- to 1350-gram infants with respiratory distress syndrome. The American Exosurf Neonatal Study Group I 
 In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled rescue trial conducted at 21 American hospitals, two 5 ml/kg doses of a synthetic surfactant (Exosurf Neonatal) or air were administered to 419 infants weighing 700 to 1350 gm who had respiratory distress syndrome and an arterial/alveolar oxygen pressure ratio less than 0.22.
 The first dose was given between 2 and 24 hours of age; the second dose was given 12 hours later to those infants remaining on ventilatory support.
 Infants were stratified at entry by birth weight and gender.
 Among infants receiving synthetic surfactant, improvements in alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient, arterial/alveolar oxygen pressure ratio, and oxygen and ventilator needs through 7 days of age were apparent.
 Death from respiratory distress syndrome was reduced by two thirds (21 vs 7; p = 0.007), and the overall neonatal mortality rate was reduced by half (50 vs 23; p = 0.001).
 Although there was no significant reduction in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (39 vs 31; p = 0.107), the hypothesis that survival through 28 days without bronchopulmonary dysplasia would be enhanced by two rescue doses of synthetic surfactant was proved true (21% improvement, from 132 to 156 patients; p = 0.001).
 In addition, the incidence of pneumothorax was reduced by one third (62 vs 40; p = 0.022), and the incidence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema was reduced by half (102 vs 51; p = 0.001).
 The only side effect identified was an increase in the incidence of apnea (102 vs 134; p = 0.001).
 These findings indicate that rescue use of a synthetic surfactant can improve the morbidity and mortality rates for premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome.

"Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion.
 Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall involvement continues to present a major clinical challenge.
 We have treated 52 patients since 1973, excluding those with superior sulcus tumors.
 There were 37 male and 15 female patients with an average age of 62.9 years.
 Chest pain was an initial symptom in 37%.
 All patients had negative mediastinoscopy results.
 Squamous cell carcinoma was present in 53% and adenocarcinoma in 35%.
 The median number of ribs resected was two (range, one to six), and only 2 patients required chest wall reconstruction.
 Pathologic staging was T3 N0 M0 in 83% and T3 N1 M0 in 17%.
 Operative mortality was 3.8%.
 Absolute 5-year survival was 26.3%.
 Patients who had N1 disease had a 5-year survival of only 11%.
 Radiation therapy was employed in 46% for positive nodes or close margins.
 Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion remains potentially curable if N2 nodes are not involved.
 The role of radiation therapy has not been clearly defined.

"The spontaneous course of nasal obstruction in patients with normal nasal airway resistance.
 Sixty-seven patients, candidates for septoplasty in the years 1976-1978 because of nasal obstruction and deviated nasal septum, but not having surgery because their nasal airway resistance was normal, were reviewed in 1982 and again in 1989.
 Between 1982 and 1989, 6% of the patients became free of their respective nasal complaints, and 18% of their nasal obstruction, the corresponding overall figures for the period between 1976 and 1978, and 1989, being 20 and 36%.
 In fact, the majority of the patients were suffering from vasomotor rhinitis and because in so many cases nasal obstruction tends to disappear as time goes on, a conservative waiting policy would seem to be an appropriate approach to treatment.

 Epidural morphine provided postoperative analgesia.
 This combination permitted early ambulation and prevention of thromboembolism.

 We studied 21 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and presumed Pneumocystic carinii choroidopathy.
 The lesions were characteristically yellow to pale yellow in color, appeared at the level of the choroid, and were found in the posterior pole.
 They varied in size from 300 to 3,000 microns, initially increasing in number before treatment and eventually resolving after systemic antimicrobial therapy.
 Of the 21 patients, 18 (86%) had received inhaled pentamidine as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia.
 Visual acuity and visual field testing showed little evidence of retinal destruction.
 Survival after the diagnosis of the choroidopathy ranged from two to 36 weeks.
 Pneumocystic choroidopathy offers an easily accessible clue to disseminated Pneumocystis infection.
 When comparing drugs for Pneumocystis prophylaxis, careful ocular examination can provide one indicator of the relative efficacy of protection against extrapulmonary disease.

"Interleukin-2 therapy in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma: a phase II study.
 Forty-seven patients with metastatic malignant melanoma were treated with two 5-day cycles of 100,000 U/kg recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) intravenously (IV) every 4 hours separated by 1 week.
 This dose and schedule of IL-2 were identical to those used in a previous combined IL-2 and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell phase II clinical trial of the IL-2/LAK Working Group.
 Patient eligibility criteria, and clinical management guidelines were similar to those used in the previous trial.
 Forty-six patients were assessable for response.
 Objective responses were observed in 10 of 46 patients (two complete responses [CRs], eight partial responses [PRs]) or 22% with responses occurring in lung and liver as well as lymph nodes and subcutaneous sites.
 The median response duration was 8 months.
 Toxicity was significant; three patients developed myocardial infarction, and one patient died during therapy.
 Overall the toxicity and response rate for single-agent IL-2 are similar to that observed with IL-2 administered in combination with LAK cells in the previous trial.
 These results suggest that single-agent therapy with IL-2 when administered in this schedule has significant antimelanoma activity in humans, and that LAK cells generated from peripheral blood add little to the antimelanoma activity of this dose and schedule of IL-2.

"Incidence of colonization, nosocomial pneumonia, and mortality in critically ill patients using a Trach Care closed-suction system versus an open-suction system: prospective, randomized study.
 Eighty-four intubated, mechanically ventilated patients were prospectively evaluated for incidences of colonization and nosocomial pneumonias dependent on whether they received endotracheal suctioning by an ""open"" suction method vs.
 ""closed"" suction (Trach Care Closed Suction System) method.
 Results show that closed suctioning is associated with a significant (67% vs.
 39% p less than .02) increase in colonization compared with open suctioning.
 However, difference in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was not significantly (26% vs.
 29%) different between closed and open suctioning.
 Differences in severity of illness (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), age, sex, presence of NG tubes, use of H2 antagonists or antacids, use of antibiotics, and history of smoking were all nonsignificant.
 Survival analysis demonstrated that the probability of survival without developing nosocomial pneumonia was greater among closed-suctioning patients vs.
 open-suctioned patients (p less than .03).
 This study shows that suctioning performed via the Trach Care closed-suction system increases the incidence of colonization but not the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, and may actually decrease mortality when compared with open-suction systems.

"Transtracheal delivery of oxygen: efficacy and safety for long-term continuous therapy.
 Transtracheal (TT) oxygen delivery involves administration of oxygen percutaneously through a catheter inserted in the suprasternal trachea.
 Transtracheal oxygen delivery has been proposed as a means of overcoming the high visibility, inconvenience, and discomfort associated with nasal cannula use.
 This report describes our experience using TT delivery in 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 32) and other types of lung disease (n = 8).
 Overall acceptance of TT catheter use was high and only 5 subjects elected to discontinue use.
 We believe the TT route is a relatively safe approach for oxygen administration and a promising method of improving patient compliance.
 It also offers the potential of more adequately oxygenating patients with refractory hypoxemia.

"Spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treated with prophylactic aerosolized pentamidine.
 Spontaneous pneumothorax is a known complication of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 To evaluate the possible pathogenesis and natural history of pneumothorax in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis, we retrospectively reviewed 327 outpatients positive for human immunodeficiency virus receiving aerosolized pentamidine.
 There were 12 spontaneous pneumothoraces in this group of patients.
 Seventy-five percent of patients with pneumothorax had roentgenographic evidence of fibrocystic lung parenchyma and clinical evidence of active Pneumocystis pneumonia.
 The majority (83%) required chest tube evacuation.
 There was a 50% mortality rate associated with this complication.

 Fifty-three patients underwent laser cordectomy for T1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma between January 1980 and December 1989--sixteen after having undergone unsuccessful radiation and thirty-seven who had no previous treatment.
 There was a 51% five-year cure rate in the irradiated group vs.
 62% in the nonirradiated group.
 Extension of tumor to the anterior commissure resulted in a higher failure rate.
 Patients experienced an overall 5-year cure rate of 98% after surgical or radiation salvage of unsuccessful laser cordectomies.
 Six patients had preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy.
 The most common postoperative problem with voice was a breathiness that did not resolve in any of the patients.
 All patients had absent or moderately reduced amplitude and mucosal wave patterns and imcomplete glottic closure proportional to the amount of cordal tissue removed.
 Despite it seemingly poor results in carefully selected patients, laser cordectomy is still indicated without compromising the ultimate oncologic results.
 Advantages over radiation therapy or conservation laryngeal surgery include a short treatment time, requiring only an outpatient surgical procedure at the time of the initial diagnostic and/or staging laryngoscopy, and the avoidance of potential radiation side effects or surgical complications.
 However, patients should be advised the possibility of persistent postoperative breathy dysphonia, in addition to the possibility of further treatment to effect a long-term cure.

"Role of early fluid resuscitation in pediatric septic shock.
 OBJECTIVE.
 To examine the association of the volume of fluid administered at 1 and 6 hours after presentation, with survival and the occurrence of the adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and persistent hypovolemia during the resuscitation of children with septic shock.
 SETTING AND PATIENTS.
 All pediatric patients with septic shock presenting to the emergency department over a 6-year period and having a pulmonary artery catheter inserted by 6 hours after presentation were identified.
 METHODS.
 Patients were analyzed together and in three groups based on fluid volume in the first hour: group 1, less than 20 mL/kg; group 2, 20 to 40 mL/kg; and group 3, more than 40 mL/kg.
 Adult respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed by the presence of alveolar infiltrates, hypoxemia, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or less.
 Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was diagnosed similarly, except the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was greater than 15 mm Hg.
 Hypovolemia was diagnosed by the presence of oliguria, hypotension, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg or less 6 hours after presentation.
 RESULTS.
 We identified 34 patients (median age, 13.5 months).
 At 1 and 6 hours, respectively, group 1 (n = 14) received 11 +/- 6 and 71 +/- 29 mL/kg (mean +/- SD) of fluid; group 2 received 32 +/- 5 and 108 +/- 54 mL/kg of fluid; and group 3 received 69 +/- 19 and 117 +/- 29 mL/kg of fluid.
 Survival in group 3 (eight of nine patients) was significantly better than in group 1 (six of 14 patients) or group 2 (four of 11 patients).
 Adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in 11 patients (32%) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema developed in five patients (15%).
 Having adult respiratory distress syndrome was associated with increased mortality, but adult respiratory distress syndrome was not increased in any group.
 Similarly, cardiogenic pulmonary edema was not associated with the fluid volume received or with decreased survival.
 Hypovolemia occurred in six patients in group 1 and two patients in group 2; all eight subsequently died.
 CONCLUSION.
 Rapid fluid resuscitation in excess of 40 mL/kg in the first hour following emergency department presentation was associated with improved survival, decreased occurrence of persistent hypovolemia, and no increase in the risk of cardiogenic pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome in this group of pediatric patients with septic shock.

"Physical and psychosocial consequences of total laryngectomy.
 The incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy and their influence on daily living were studied in 59 laryngectomized patients.
 Daily sputum production was the principal complaint of these patients (98%), followed by coughing (64%) and the need for frequent forced expectoration (more than 5 times a day) in order to clear the airway (57%).
 Frequent stoma cleaning (more than 5 times a day) was required by 37% of the patients.
 Significant correlation was found between respiratory symptoms, voice rehabilitation and several aspects of daily living, including fatigue, sleep problems, social contacts and psychological distress.
 These findings indicate that respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy are both frequent and troublesome.

 Both subsequently presented with pulmonary hemorrhage, fever, arthritis, hematuria, and nephrotic range proteinuria at 1.5 and 6 years of age, respectively.
 Renal biopsy in each case showed acute, severe, focal and segmental, necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis without immune deposits.
 Subsequent renal biopsies revealed severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring.
 No vasculitis or granulomas were seen on renal, skin, or lung biopsies.
 Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were not detected in sera taken 1.5 years in the boy and 3.5 years in the girl after the onset of renal disease.
 The boy was treated with prednisone, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis, but developed progressive renal impairment and commenced dialysis within 4 years.
 Subsequent to renal transplantation, he developed an immunoblastic lymphoma and died.
 The girl was treated initially with prednisone and later with cyclophosphamide.
 After 4 years, she had a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
 While necrotizing nonimmune glomerulonephritis associated with pulmonary hemorrhage is rare, and cases are characteristically difficult to classify because of many overlapping features, it is possible that these children had a unique illness.

"Ifosfamide extrapyramidal neurotoxicity.
 Ifosfamide-associated central nervous system toxicity has been reported in 5% to 30% of patients treated with ifosfamide.
 Its pattern is characterized by metabolic encephalopathy with confusion, blurred vision, mutism, auditory or visual paranoid hallucinations, seizures, and rarely coma.
 The biochemical cause of the neurotoxicity is not understood completely, but it is thought to result from an accumulation of drug metabolites with direct central nervous system effects.
 A case of ifosfamide neurotoxicity is reported that had unusual extrapyramidal features in a patient treated with a 5-day course of infused ifosfamide.
 Although usually spontaneously reversible with cessation of drug administration, ifosfamide neurotoxicity occasionally has been associated with prolonged psychopathologic sequelae.

"Adoptive immunotherapy using lymphokine-activated killer cells and recombinant interleukin-2 in preventing and treating spontaneous pulmonary metastases of syngeneic Dunning rat prostate tumor.
 Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were generated from splenocytes of rats bearing a weakly immunogenic Dunning prostate tumor (R-3227 AT-3) and activated with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2).
 The maximal LAK activity was obtained from splenocytes of rats bearing tumors for 10 to 14 days after incubation with 1000 U/ml./day of rIL-2 for five to eight days.
 The majority of these LAK cells expressed high levels of asialo GM1 (89%), laminin (83%), OX-19 (80%) and OX-8 (88%) surface markers.
 LAK cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity to rat prostate tumor cells and mouse lymphoma in vitro than to other non-prostate tumor cells or normal rat splenocytes and thymocytes.
 Splenocytes of rats bearing prostate tumors have higher LAK activity than normal splenocytes.
 The Winn type assay showed that Dunning prostate tumor growth was inhibited effectively by LAK cells at a tumor cell:LAK cell ratio of 1:50.
 The therapeutic efficacy of LAK cells in the treatment of primary solid prostate tumors and pulmonary metastases of Dunning rats was evaluated.
 LAK cells in combination with rIL-2 showed a greater therapeutic benefit in 1) prevention of prostate tumor metastases to lung, 2) retardation of the primary tumor growth, 3) regression of spontaneously established pulmonary metastases, and 4) prolongation of survival as compared to untreated controls or those groups treated with LAK cells or rIL-2 alone.
 The results of this study indicate that the conjunctive therapeutic approach of using surgical therapy to remove primary solid tumors followed by adoptive immunotherapy with LAK cells plus in vivo administration of IL-2 may be potentially valuable in the treatment of prostate tumors, particularly for the spontaneous pulmonary metastases.

 To determine the risk of active tuberculosis associated with HIV infection, we retrospectively studied a cohort of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative women participating in an HIV perinatal transmission study in Kinshasa, Zaire.
 After a median follow-up of 32 months, new cases of proven pulmonary or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis occurred in 19 of the 249 HIV-seropositive women (7.6%, 3.1 cases per 100 person-years) compared with 1 of the 310 HIV-seronegative women (0.3%, 0.12 cases per 100 person-years), for a relative risk of 26 (95% confidence interval, 5 to 125).
 Proven pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 7 HIV-seropositive women (2.8%, 1.2 cases per 100 person-years) and 1 HIV-seronegative woman (0.3%, 0.12 cases per 100 person-years), for a relative risk of 10 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 47).
 We estimated that 66 cases of proven pulmonary tuberculosis in 100,000 person-years of follow-up in women of childbearing age could be attributed to HIV; this is 35% of their estimated total incidence of proven pulmonary tuberculosis.

 Our hypotheses were that these new postoperative defects occurred with great frequency and did not represent postoperative vessel occlusion.
 We retrospectively reviewed the preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of 33 consecutive patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
 New postoperative perfusion defects were noted in 23 of 33 patients.
 The incidence of new defects was increased tenfold in segments that had (1) normal preoperative angiographic findings, (2) normal preoperative radionuclide perfusion, and (3) not been entered at the time of surgery.
 Postoperative angiograms, available in 15 of 33 patients, documented the nonembolic, nonocclusive nature of the new perfusion scan defects.
 The most plausible alternate explanation for this previously undescribed finding is a redistribution of pulmonary arterial resistance induced by the thromboendarterectomy, namely, a pulmonary vascular ""steal."".

"Indications for spirometry in outpatients with respiratory disease.
 It has been suggested that spirometry should be incorporated into the routine examination of every patient, analogous to obtaining vital signs.
 To determine the impact of spirometry on the management of outpatients with respiratory disease, spirometry was performed on 150 consecutive patients (123 men and 27 women, mean age 57 +/- 12 years) seen in our pulmonary disease outpatient clinics.
 Patients with obstructive (n = 75), restrictive (n = 31), mixed (n = 26) or other respiratory diseases (n = 18) were initially assessed by history and physical examination and classified as improved, stable, or worse compared to previous visits.
 A clinical management plan (CMP) was formulated based on this initial evaluation.
 Spirometric results were then made available to the examiner who could then make changes in the proposed CMP.
 The addition of spirometric results caused alteration of the CMP in only eight (5 percent) patients; in the remaining 142 patients, results did not affect the CMP.
 Two clinical findings identified those patients whose CMP was most likely to be altered by spirometry: severity of lung dysfunction (determined from previous spirometry) and deterioration of clinical status (judged by history and physical examination).
 Of the eight patients whose CMP was changed after review of spirometry, six (75 percent) had previous severe ventilatory dysfunction (FEV1 or FVC less than or equal to 40 percent of predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio less than or equal to 0.40).
 In 6 of 38 patients (16 percent) with severe ventilatory dysfunction, CMP was altered after spirometry while only 2 of 112 patients (1.8 percent) with mild or moderate dysfunction had changes in their CMP.
 Patients who were clinically assessed as worse compared to their previous visit were more likely to have their CMP altered after review of spirometry when compared to those considered improved or stable by a ratio of 6:1.
 These results suggest that spirometry is most likely to supplement the physician's history and physical examination in the management of outpatients with pulmonary disease when the initial evaluation suggests that the patient has clinically deteriorated since the previous clinic visit, or when he or she has previous severe ventilatory dysfunction.

"A clinicopathological study of the paraneoplastic neuromuscular syndromes associated with lung cancer.
 The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma.
 The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively.
 Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer.
 Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production).
 Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer.
 Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis.
 The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications.
 Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls.
 Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy.
 Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy.
 This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
 Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit.

 Fifty ASA grade 1 children, who presented for dental outpatient extraction were studied.
 They were randomly allocated to two groups after induction: group 1 had conventional nasal mask anaesthesia and group 2 anaesthesia with a laryngeal mask.
 Group 2 had fewer hypoxic episodes and significantly better arterial oxygen saturations (p less than 0.01).
 There was no difference between the groups as regards surgical access, difficulty of extraction or bleeding.
 The laryngeal mask appears to provide an alternative to conventional nasal mask anaesthesia, with better overall oxygenation and would seem particularly suitable for prolonged or difficult extractions.

"The ras oncogenes in human lung cancer.
 The three well-characterized genes of the ras gene family H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras, code for closely related 21-kD proteins that have a role in the transduction of growth signals.
 The ras proteins acquire transforming potential when a point mutation in the gene leads to replacement of an amino acid in one of the critical positions 12, 13, or 61.
 Overexpression of the normal protein, usually associated with gene amplification, can have similar effects.
 The detection of mutationally activated ras genes has been facilitated by the development of oligonucleotide hybridization assays that allow the identification of each possible mutation at the critical sites.
 Employment of the polymerase chain reaction has greatly increased the sensitivity of these assays.
 Studies of human lung cancer have shown that adenocarcinoma is the only subtype associated with ras mutations.
 These occur in about 30% of primary tumors.
 In almost all cases, the mutation is present in codon 12 of the K-ras gene.
 No mutations have been observed to date in tumors of nonsmokers, suggesting that the mutation may result from exposure to carcinogenic ingredients of tobacco smoke.
 Amplifications of ras genes were shown to be very uncommon in clinically early stages of lung cancer.
 Analysis of the clinical data of patients who were operated on for adenocarcinoma of the lung shows that K-ras mutations are not associated with particular histologic characteristics of the tumors or with specific presenting features.
 Patients with K-ras mutations, however, had significantly worse survival than did those without an activation.

"Efficacy of positive vs negative pressure ventilation in unloading the respiratory muscles.
 We compared the efficacy of positive pressure ventilation (PPV) vs negative pressure ventilation (NPV) in providing ventilatory muscle rest for five normal subjects and six patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 All participants underwent measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), pressure time integral of the diaphragm (PTI), integrated diaphragmatic electromyogram (iEMG), minute ventilation (Ve), tidal volume (Vt), and end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) during 15 minutes of PPV and NPV.
 For each subject, ventilator adjustments were made to obtain Ve similar to levels measured during quiet breathing (QB).
 We found that the iEMG, Pdi, PTI, and average coefficient of variation of the tidal volume (CV-Vt) were consistently lower during PPV as compared with NPV (p = 0.01).
 The iEMG normalized for Ve and Vt was also significantly lower during PPV (p = 0.01).
 During PPV, subjects were mildly hyperventilated (lower etCO2 and higher Ve) compared with QB and NPV, but no significant correlation was noted between the change in etCO2 and the change in iEMG.
 The change in PTI was significantly correlated with the change in iEMG (p less than 0.01).
 We conclude that in the short term, PPV is more effective than NPV in reducing diaphragmatic activity.
 Positive pressure ventilation may be the preferred method of assisted ventilation in future studies of ventilatory muscle rest therapy.

"Recurrent laryngeal nerve avulsion for treatment of spastic dysphonia.
 Treatment of spastic dysphonia by recurrent laryngeal nerve section has resulted in reproducibly good results in the early postoperative period in most patients.
 However, critical long-term follow-up has shown a high recurrence rate of adductor spasms by the third year after initial nerve section.
 A patient who developed recurring adductor spasms 1 year after nerve section was reexplored, with identification of neural regrowth into the distal segment of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
 The technique of neural avulsion removing the distal nerve up to its insertion into the laryngeal muscles is described.
 Neural regrowth, which is just one of the possible mechanisms for recurrence of spastic dysphonia, should be prevented by this surgical modification.
 Twelve patients who have undergone neural avulsion primarily for spastic dysphonia are being followed up without recurrence of symptoms thus far.
 Although these results appear promising, this short follow-up that averages 1.5 years must be extended to firmly support these concepts.

"Cerebral venous oxygen content as a measure of brain energy metabolism with increased intracranial pressure and hyperventilation.
 In order to test the hypothesis that the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) and venous oxygen content (VO2) could be used to monitor brain energy metabolism in the setting of increased intracranial pressure (ICP).
 12 cats were studied with 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
 six cats were subjected to intracranial hypertension by cisternal infusion of saline.
 Energy failure occurred at an average AVDO2 of 8.4 +/- 3.2 vol% (+/- standard deviation) (range 4.7 to 14.7 vol%).
 The VO2 at the point of metabolic failure averaged 1.45 +/- 0.6 vol% and extended over a narrower range (1.0 to 2.9 vol%).
 In an additional six cats, ICP was raised to the threshold of metabolic failure and hyperventilation was then instituted (pCO2 10 to 18 torr).
 Five of the six cats experienced a drop in VO2 with hyperventilation.
 In two of these animals, hyperventilation resulted in a VO2 of 1.1 vol% or less and in metabolic failure as evidenced by a fall in phosphocreatine.
 It is concluded that a VO2 of less than 2 vol% is correlated with brain ischemia and that the safety of hyperventilation in the setting of increased ICP can be monitored by the use of VO2.

 Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups.
 The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively.

"Continuous, in vivo pulmonary venous admixture from fiberoptically measured hemoglobin saturations.
 In six anesthetized swine, pulmonary venous admixture (Qsp/Qt) was calculated by four methods: a) Qsp/Qt 1, fiberoptically measured arterial and mixed venous Hgb saturation (SaO2 and SvO2), PaO2 and PvO2 derived from saturations; b) Qsp/Qt 2, fiberoptically measured SaO2 and SvO2, PaO2 and PvO2 measured by blood gas analysis; c) Qsp/Qt 3, PaO2 and PvO2 measured by blood gas analysis, SaO2 and SvO2 derived from tensions; d) Qsp/Qt 4, SaO2 and SvO2 measured by bench oximetry, PaO2 and PvO2 derived from saturations.
 Input from the fiberoptic catheters was fed into a computer programmed to calculate Qsp/Qt 1 every 20 sec.
 Fifty-eight of these values were compared with simultaneously calculated Qsp/Qt 2, 3, and 4.
 There was no difference between fiberoptic and derived SaO2 or fiberoptic and cooximetric SvO2.
 Correlations and slopes for Qsp/Qt 1 with Qsp/Qt 2, 3, and 4 were significant (p less than .05).
 Comparing mean differences, Qsp/Qt 1 was significantly different only from Qsp/Qt 3 (p less than .01).

"Reliability of six pulse oximeters in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Six pulse oximeters with finger probes were studied in three groups of 17 hypoxemic patients with COPD aged 50 to 75 years.
 Transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured with the Nellcor N101 (oximeter 1a), the Ohmeda Biox III (oximeter lb), the Nellcor N200 (oximeter 2a), the Critikon Oxyshuttle (oximeter 2b), the Radiometer Oxi100 (oximeter 3a), and the Ohmeda Biox 3700 (oximeter 3b).
 The SpO2 was compared with SaO2 measured in simultaneously withdrawn samples of arterial blood (Radiometer OSM2) at three 20-minute steady-state levels of FIO2 ranging from 0.21 to 0.40 (SaO2, 62 to 100 percent).
 The bias (mean SpO2-SaO2 difference) and the error in precision (SD of the differences) were both below 4 percent for instruments 1a and 1b and remained below 1.2 and 3 percent, respectively, for the others.
 A good agreement between SpO2 and SaO2, as reflected by the Bartko intraclass correlation coefficient, was observed in instruments 2a, 3a, and 3b.
 The individual relationships between SpO2-SaO2 differences and SaO2 appeared to be linear and parallel.
 With four instruments (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b), the mean slope of this relationship was negative, showing a systematic instrumental error: the lower the SaO2, the larger the overestimation of SaO2.
 The scattering of the data (precision) principally reflects a subject source of error.
 In most instruments a technical adjustment could greatly improve instrumental errors and accuracy.
 The correction of the errors due to between-subject variation would require a system of calibration adjustable by the users to each individual.

"Right ventricular function assessed by thermodilution technique during apnea and mechanical ventilation.
 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate strategies for thermodilution-based measurement of cardiac output and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction and to assess the effects of controlled mechanical ventilation in patients.
 Furthermore, to compare strategy-associated reproducibility with reference values obtained during long-term apnea.
 DESIGN: Crossover trial in patients; reference values from apneic animals.
 SETTING: University ICU and physiology laboratory.
 PATIENTS: Six consecutive male ICU patients (48 to 70 yrs) after major abdominal vascular surgery.
 Animals: two adult female sheep.
 INTERVENTIONS: Three ventilatory rates (8, 16, and 24 cycles/min) and 15-sec periods of apnea were selected for measurements in patients.
 In animals, continuous apnea was achieved with extracorporeal CO2 removal and apneic oxygenation.
 MEASUREMENTS: Measurements were performed using an appropriate pulmonary artery catheter and an ejection fraction/cardiac output computer prototype.
 The thermal indicator was injected automatically at four defined points of the ventilatory cycle, but triggered manually during apnea.
 MAIN RESULTS: At 8 cycles/min, there was a wide mean range of cyclic variable modulation, with a coefficient of variation of 11.6% and 23.2% for cardiac output and RV ejection fraction, respectively.
 Allowing for ventilatory phase or changing from 8 to 16 cycles/min reduced errors by half.
 Combining both procedures resulted in a coefficient of variation of 4.7% and 6.6% for cardiac output and RV ejection fraction, respectively.
 The best coefficient of variation values obtained during 15 secs of apnea in patients approached those variations in experimental apnea (coefficient of variation of 2.1% and 4.5% for cardiac output and RV ejection fraction, respectively).
 CONCLUSIONS: At low ventilatory rates, best results are achieved by averaging four phase-selected measurements.
 One-point measurements were less accurate and random point measurements less reproducible.

"Effect of atelectasis and surface tension on pulmonary vascular compliance.
 The effects of atelectasis and surface tension on the vascular volume and compliance in an isolated perfused dog lung lobe were studied using vascular occlusion and indicator-dilution methods.
 Measurements were made during atelectasis and again after the lobes were inflated with either a gas mixture (air) or 0.9% saline.
 Inflation with air resulted in a 20% increase in vascular volume (P less than 0.02), whereas saline inflation had no effect on vascular volume.
 Inflation with either air or saline increased static vascular compliance by approximately 58% (P less than 0.001) and dynamic vascular compliance by approximately 85% (P less than 0.001).
 The larger dynamic compliance in the inflated lobes appears to have been mainly due to a larger microvascular compliance.
 The results suggest that atelectasis can result in a stiffer pulmonary capillary bed.
 This effect appears to be due primarily to the reconfiguration of the lung tissue structure, because replacing the air with an incompressible fluid did not have the same effect.

"Randomized trial of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine versus cisplatin and etoposide versus alternation of these regimens in small-cell lung cancer.
 Between April 1985 and May 1988, we conducted a randomized study comparing two standard chemotherapy regimens with the same regimens given on an alternating basis in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
 The patients were randomly assigned to receive cyclophosphamide at a dose of 800 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on day 1, doxorubicin at 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1, and vincristine at 1.4 mg/m2 IV on day 1 (CAV); cisplatin at 80 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and etoposide at 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 3, and 5 (PE); or CAV alternating with PE (CAV/PE).
 Each regimen was repeated every 3-4 weeks.
 Three hundred patients were entered in the study, and 288 of them were eligible for analysis (97 for CAV, 97 for PE, and 94 for CAV/PE).
 The response rates for PE (78%) and CAV/PE (76%) were significantly higher than the rate for CAV (55%), while the complete response rates were similar (14%, 16%, and 15%, respectively).
 Nine (23%) of 39 patients who failed to respond to the initial CAV regimen responded to PE when they were crossed over.
 In contrast, only one (8%) of 13 patients responded to CAV after failing to respond to the PE regimen, suggesting that these two regimens were partially non-cross-resistant.
 The response duration on CAV/PE was significantly longer than that with CAV (P = .004).
 The survival time with CAV/PE (11.8 months) was superior to that with CAV (9.9 months) (P = .027) or that with PE (9.9 months) (P = .056).
 In patients with limited disease, the survival in the alternating arm was significantly superior to the survival in the CAV arm (P = .014) or the survival in the PE arm (P = .023).
 The toxic effects were acceptable in all three chemotherapy regimens.
 These results favor the alternating chemotherapy over either standard chemotherapy, such as CAV and PE, although the differences are not dramatic.

"Pulmonary edema induced by phagocytosing neutrophils. Protective effect of monoclonal antibody against phagocyte CD18 integrin.
 We studied the changes in pulmonary hemodynamics and lung wet weight induced with opsonized zymosan (OZ) in isolated guinea pig lungs perfused with Ringer-albumin solution containing neutrophils (PMNs).
 Addition of OZ to the PMN-perfused lungs caused pulmonary vasoconstriction and weight gain; neither OZ nor PMNs added individually to the perfusate altered pulmonary vasomotor tone or wet weight.
 The steady gain in lung weight by 1,588 +/- 464 mg over the 45-minute study period was associated with pulmonary capillary hypertension and an increase in the capillary filtration coefficient, indicative of increased lung vascular permeability.
 These responses may not be due to generation of oxygen radicals, because the alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics and lung weight were not reduced by addition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, or superoxide dismutase plus catalase.
 We examined the basis of the PMN-mediated effects by layering PMNs on bovine pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers.
 Challenge with OZ resulted in increased endothelial permeability to 125I-albumin.
 The monoclonal antibody IB4 (directed against CD18, the common beta-subunit of structurally related adhesion receptors on phagocytes, LFA-1, Mac-1, and P150,95) prevented the OZ-mediated increase in PMN adherence to endothelial cells and the increase in endothelial permeability to 125I-albumin.
 IB4 also inhibited the lung weight gain mediated by the OZ-stimulated PMNs in intact lungs.
 The protective effect of IB4 could be ascribed neither to inhibition of uptake of OZ by PMNs nor to inhibition of release of oxygen radicals, myeloperoxidase, and elastase.

 To determine the etiological role of human papillomavirus in inverted papilloma, and to clarify the relationship between human papillomavirus and malignant transformation of this benign tumor, we retrospectively analyzed inverted papillomas from 26 patients, 7 of whom had squamous cell carcinoma.
 We used an immunohistochemical method and molecular pathologic techniques, or dot-blot hybridization of DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction.
 Human papillomavirus was detected in 5 of 26 patients (19%), 3 patients with human papillomavirus 11 and 2 patients with human papillomavirus 16.
 The latter 2 patients had inverted papillomas associated with squamous cell carcinoma.
 We speculate that human papillomavirus may be related to the malignant transformation of inverted papillomas.

"Severe preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia secondary to uvular edema. A case report.
 In addition to hypertension and proteinuria, generalized edema is seen commonly in women with severe preeclampsia.
 A patient presented to us at term with the complaint of dysphonia.
 Upon examination she appeared to be clearly preeclamptic and had a grossly edemetous uvula, which we think occurred secondary to generalized edema.
 This case might be the first reported one of preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia and of uvular edema in association with preeclampsia.

"Pulmonary concerns and the exercise prescription.
 When writing an exercise prescription, the contributions of the pulmonary system are commonly forgotten.
 The lung has a tremendous potential to improve its work output, and its contributions are only realized when pulmonary disease or environmental stresses of altitude limit pulmonary performance.
 At altitudes of 5000 feet above sea level, hypoxia is significant in limiting aerobic capacity, and the exercise prescription should follow relative percentages of VO2max guided by the training heart rate rather than actual work output.
 Training at altitude will improve performance at altitude, but training at altitude does not always improve sea level performance.
 Suggestions of using longer recovery intervals, sojourns back and forth from sea level to altitude, and shorter-duration, high-intensity exercise sessions may help improve sea level performance, but more research is needed.
 The limitations of reactive airway disease and exercise-induced asthma can be minimized with proper attention to training techniques, environmental modifications, and pharmacologic treatment.
 In the 1984 Olympics, 41 medals were won by athletes with the diagnosis of reactive airway disease.
 Finally, the crippling limitations of chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease can be improved by a proper exercise rehabilitation program that uses an accurate and thorough assessment procedure prior to beginning an exercise program.
 Also, careful follow-up and continual monitoring of cardiac rhythm, oximetry, and exercise intensity of the pulmonary impaired patient will result in optimal improvement in the patient's sense of well-being, tolerance to dyspnea, and increased ability to do aerobic work, as well as an enhanced quality of life.

"A multivariate analysis of the risk of pulmonary complications after laparotomy.
 We evaluated the relationship between PPC and various putative risk factors in a prospective longitudinal study of 1,000 patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
 Transient subclinical events were excluded by defining PPC as positive clinical findings in combination with either positive sputum microbiology, unexplained pyrexia, or positive chest roentgenographic findings.
 The overall incidence of PPC was 23.2 percent (232/1,000).
 Multivariate analysis identified seven factors which were associated with PPC: ASA classification greater than 2, upper abdominal surgery, residual intraperitoneal sepsis, age greater than 59 years, BMI greater than 25, preoperative hospital stay greater than 4 days, and colorectal or gastroduodenal surgery (overall F score = 33.5, p less than 0.0001).
 The ASA classification was the most powerful indicator of risk in both the univariate and the multivariate analyses.
 The combination of ASA classification greater than 1 and age greater than 59 years identified 88 percent (205 of 232) of the patients who developed PPC.
 These findings provide clinicians and clinical investigators with a simple means of identifying patients who are at high risk of PPC after abdominal surgery.

"Cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with acute severe asthma (""status asthmaticus"") spontaneously elaborate a neutrophil chemotactic activity distinct from interleukin-8.
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with acute severe asthma on the day of admission to hospital were cultured in vitro in serum-free medium in the absence of mitogenic stimulants for as long as 72 h.
 PBMC isolated from control groups (mild asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, normal subjects) were cultured in a similar fashion.
 After incubation, the culture supernatants were tested for neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) using a modified Boyden chamber technique.
 PBMC from patients with acute severe asthma elaborated significantly greater amounts of NCA into the culture supernatants as compared with all three control groups (p less than 0.01).
 The amounts of PBMC-derived NCA from the same patients after 7 days of hospital therapy and clinical improvement were reduced (p less than 0.01).
 A correlation was observed between the extent of reduction in spontaneous release of NCA by PBMC derived from patients with acute severe asthma and the degree of clinical improvement of their asthma (p less than 0.02).
 Both monocytes and lymphocytes, when cultured separately, released NCA in amounts sufficient to account for the total activity released by unfractionated PBMC.
 NCA in PBMC culture supernatants accumulated progressively with time, a process inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by cycloheximide.
 The amounts of NCA in culture supernatants did not correlate with the concentrations of histamine in lysates of the PBMC prepared just prior to culture.

"Constant-flow insufflation prevents arterial oxygen desaturation during endotracheal suctioning.
 In mechanically ventilated patients, disconnection from the ventilator and endotracheal suctioning can induce major arterial oxygen desaturation resulting from apnea, changes in inspired oxygen fraction, and decrease in lung volume.
 The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a simple method of delivering oxygen and maintaining lung volume during this process.
 Our study was conducted in two parts.
 In the first part, constant-flow insufflation of oxygen (CFI) was used in seven patients ventilated for acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FlO2 = 347 +/- 33 mm Hg) as a means of maintaining arterial oxygenation during apnea and disconnection from the ventilator.
 CFI was administered via a modified endotracheal tube in which small capillaries allowed delivery of a high-velocity jet flow near the tracheal end of the tube during disconnection from the ventilator.
 In comparison to apnea alone, CFI prevented a fall in arterial oxygen tension (16 +/- 7 mm Hg during CFI versus 117 +/- 27 during apnea, after 90 s of disconnection in the two situations, p less than 0.001), whereas it did not reduce the development of hypercapnia.
 The efficacy of CFI resulted both from the injection of oxygen into the trachea and from the maintenance of positive alveolar pressure induced by air entrainment (mean 10.4 +/- 1.1 cm H2O), preventing a fall in lung volume usually occurring after disconnection (+338 +/- 88 ml during CFI versus -344 +/- 64 ml during apnea, p less than 0.01).
 In the second part of the study CFI was used to prevent arterial oxygen desaturation induced by endotracheal suctioning.

"Cytomegalovirus infections in bone marrow transplant recipients given intensive cytoreductive therapy.
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were studied in 785 bone marrow transplant recipients given intensive cytoreductive therapy.
 CMV excretion occurred in 24%, viremia in 9%, seroconversion in 40%, and overall active infection in 47%.
 CMV disease was much less common.
 Retinitis, enteritis, and pneumonitis occurred in only one, five (less than 1%), and 55 (7%) of the patients, respectively.
 Allograft recipients were more likely to develop CMV disease than were autograft patients (P = .0001) despite comparable rates of active CMV infection.
 CMV disease was rare after primary infection in both autograft and allograft recipients (0 and 1%, respectively).
 In contrast, CMV disease occurred in 16% of seropositive allograft recipients.
 Among allograft recipients, risk factors for CMV pneumonitis were seropositivity, age greater than 10 years, and acute graft-vs.-host disease, while the use of cyclosporine as prophylaxis against graft-vs.-host disease was protective.
 Although active infection rates did not decrease, the rates of CMV pneumonitis in allograft recipients during successive years declined significantly (P less than .001).

"Ultrasound in the diagnosis of the juxta-pleural lesion.
 Any opacity on a chest radiograph has a wide differential diagnosis.
 Plain radiography and computed tomography may help to differentiate whether bone, intercostal soft tissue or mediastinum are involved.
 Bronchoscopy is often negative with peripheral lesions.
 This leaves the physician with a diagnostic problem.
 We examined ultrasonically 30 patients with juxta-pleural lesions and performed cutting biopsy in 27.
 Twenty-four of these produced positive histology (90%).
 The three that were not biopsied were anechoic and had pulsatile lesions due to vascular abnormalities.
 There were four benign lesions all with hypoechoic appearances and the 20 malignant cases showed a wide spectrum of echogenicity.
 Of the malignant lesions, 90% showed pleural line disruption with reduced respiratory movement suggesting chest wall invasion.
 There were no complications, despite using cutting biopsy.

"Pharmacokinetics of cefepime in patients with respiratory tract infections.
 The steady-state pharmacokinetics of cefepime were evaluated in 10 middle-aged and elderly patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections who were receiving 1 g intravenously every 12 h.
 One preinfusion and 15 postinfusion serum samples and total urine output were collected over one dosing interval between days 3 and 8 of therapy.
 Cefepime concentrations in serum over time exhibited a multicompartmental profile.
 Peak and trough concentrations in serum determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method were 71.2 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 6.0 +/- 4.9 mg/liter, respectively.
 The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.22 +/- 0.05 liter/kg.
 Elimination half-lives ranged from 1.93 to 6.04 h (3.92 +/- 1.28 h), and total body clearances ranged from 36.9 to 102 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (73.0 +/- 19.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2).
 The disposition of cefepime at steady state in patients was comparable to previous observations in healthy elderly volunteers.
 The predictive performance of regression equations derived from single-dose studies in volunteers relating creatinine clearance with total body and renal clearances of cefepime exhibited slight biases (mean predictive errors, -9.7 and 2.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and similar precisions.
 Predicted and observed total body clearances (63.3 +/- 25.1 versus 73.0 +/- 19.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) and renal clearances (51.3 +/- 24.4 versus 49.3 +/- 19.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively) were not significantly different.
 The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in infected patients appeared to be unaltered by illness, and the steady-state disposition of cefepime was predictable from data derived from single-dose studies in volunteers.

"Relationship between blood plasma prostaglandin E2 and liver and lung metastases in colorectal cancer.
 The relationship of prostaglandin E2, of which a large amount is produced in various neoplasms, and hematogenous distant metastases was investigated in a total of 44 colorectal cancer patients because of its varied pathophysiologic potentials.
 The authors found significantly high levels of PGE2 in local venous blood draining the carcinoma and in peripheral blood in cases with liver or lung metastasis, as well as a significantly large amount of PGE2 production in the carcinoma tissue.
 The results suggest that increased local blood PGE2 could enhance the metastasis formation, and increased peripheral blood PGE2 may be useful in the detection of such metastasis in colorectal cancer.

"Early tracheostomy for primary airway management in the surgical critical care setting.
 During a 12-month period, 264 patients with multiple injuries who required mechanical ventilation were admitted to the surgical intensive care unit.
 One hundred twenty patients (46%) were disengaged from the ventilator, and 38 patients (14%) died.
 Of the remaining 106 patients (40%) 51 patients (group I) were to receive tracheostomy within 1 to 7 days, and 55 patients (group II) underwent late (8 or more days after admission) tracheostomy.
 Multiple variables in four categories (admission, operative, ventilatory, and outcome) were analyzed prospectively to define the impact that early tracheostomy had on duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care stay, and hospital stay.
 Morbidity and mortality rates of the procedures were assessed.
 Early tracheostomy, in a homogeneous group of critically ill patients, is associated with a significant decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation, as well as shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays, compared with translaryngeal endotracheal intubation.
 There were no deaths attributable to tracheostomy, and overall morbidity of the procedures was 4%.
 We conclude that early tracheostomy has an overall risk equivalent to that of endotracheal intubation.
 Furthermore, early tracheostomy shortens days on the ventilator and intensive care unit and hospital days and should be considered for patients in the intensive care unit at risk for more than 7 days of intubation.

"Role of histamine in natural killer cell-mediated resistance against tumor cells.
 The formation of lung metastases by i.v.-injected B16 melanoma (F1 and F10 strain) cells in Swiss albino, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation.
 The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit, a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound, nor-dimaprit, or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide.
 A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine, tiotidine, famotidine, or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis.
 Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells, as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1.
 NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells.
 The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments, combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis, whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone.
 The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells.

"Effects of prolonged inhalation of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine in rabbits.
 On the basis of its potent proinflammatory and spasmogenic effects, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), a bacterial oligopeptide, is a putative mediator of bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation during bacterial bronchial infection.
 However, after an FMLP dose-response curve in rabbits, tachyphylaxis to a second challenge was seen in some rabbits and airway inflammation was absent.
 This study was designed to reproduce the more prolonged airway exposure to FMLP that may occur during bacterial infection.
 Two groups of rabbits received FMLP [5 mg/ml in 66% dimethyl sulfoxide- (DMSO) saline] or DMSO diluent alone by nebulization every 15 min for 2 h.
 Pulmonary resistance (RL) was measured at 1 and 2 h.
 Recovery from bronchoconstriction was also assessed by measuring RL every 30 min for 2 h after the final FMLP administration.
 Sections of trachea and large bronchi were prepared and graded by quadrant from 0 to 3 for inflammation, a total score from 0 to 12 being given for each section.
 There was a progressive increase in RL in FMLP-treated rabbits, reaching 68 +/- 9% above baseline after 120 min, a significantly greater change than after diluent, 8 +/- 12% (P less than 0.01).
 RL remained elevated above baseline for 90 min after the final FMLP dose.
 Inflammation scores were greater after FMLP than DMSO: 9.3 +/- 0.5 vs.
 4.3 +/- 0.7 (P less than 0.01) in trachea and 5.2 +/- 0.4 vs.
 1.7 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.01) in lobar bronchi.
 We conclude that prolonged exposure of airways to FMLP produces a sustained increase in RL and airway inflammation, the cardinal features of infective exacerbations of chronic airflow limitation.

 Pre-operative and postoperative functional evaluation is available for the 11 patients followed up for more than a month; at 1 to 3 months postoperatively there were increases in FVC (mean 2.0 litres pre-operatively to 2.7 litres postoperatively, p less than 0.001), in FEV1 (0.74 to 1.06 litres, p = 0.01), and in maximum exercise treadmill times (5.4 min to 8.0 min, p less than 0.01).
 Postoperative air leaks lasted a mean of 13 days and usually resolved spontaneously.

"The beta-type transforming growth factor. Mediators of cell regulation in the lung.
 An increased interest in the role of growth factors in the regulation of processes concerning normal and pathologic lung physiology has spurred a flurry of research in this area.
 Peptide growth factors are known to control not only cell proliferation but other events such as differentiation, chemotaxis, and matrix deposition as well.
 The transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family of regulatory peptides serves as a prime example to illustrate the multiplicity of effects elicited by peptide growth factors in various lung-derived cell types.
 At present, the TGF beta family consists of at least 17 proteins and, based on sequence analysis, they can be divided into two groups: a cluster that shows very high sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the closely related group, and a cluster that shows weaker sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the distantly related group.
 The purpose of this brief review is to summarize the salient features of TGF beta structure and regulatory abilities of the closely related group.
 In addition, we will outline the evidence suggesting a role for TGF beta in normal lung development and physiology.
 Emphasis will be placed on studies with the closely related members TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 because, until recently, purified protein was available only for these two proteins.

"Evolution of nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a daytime PaO2 above 60 mm Hg.
 We studied 31 clinically stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with a PaO2 greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg using polysomnographic sleep study at baseline (between 1983 and 1986) and at a mean follow-up time of 42.5 months to examine the evolution of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation (NOD).
 Arterial blood gases and spirometry measured at baseline and follow-up were compared with mean nocturnal SaO2 and to other REM sleep SaO2 parameters.
 We postulated that the onset of NOD would be seen most frequently in those patients with marked derangements of lung mechanics and greater longitudinal deterioration in arterial blood gases.
 Eight of the subjects developed REM-NOD on follow-up polysomnography.
 The appearance of REM-NOD was not related, or only minimally so, to initial PaO2, PaCO2, or mean nocturnal SaO2.
 Upon follow-up, however, the onset of NOD was always associated with deterioration of daytime PaO2 and PaCO2, mainly in those patients with the most severe baseline derangement of spirometry (lung mechanics).
 On the other hand, one group showed equivalent deterioration in daytime PaO2 and a stable PaCO2 but had less severely deranged baseline mechanics and demonstrated a fall in mean nocturnal SaO2 only.
 The findings in this latter group indicate that the development of NOD is not purely a result of decreasing daytime PaO2.
 We conclude that the onset of REM-NOD is mainly related to a severe derangement of lung mechanics with deterioration of resting awake gas exchange (progressive hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and worsening airflow).

 To compare the effects of three different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the cough reflex, capsaicin and citric acid challenge tests were done in normal subjects and hypertensive patients before and after administration of delapril, captopril, or enalapril.
 Two groups of 7 normal subjects (single dose study: 15 mg delapril v 18.75 mg captopril or 2.5 mg enalapril) and a group of 6 mildly hypertensive patients (1 week study: cross-over administration of 30 mg/day delapril, 37.5 mg/day captopril, or 5 mg/day enalapril) were studied.
 Another group of 6 patients with essential hypertension was treated with three ACE inhibitors for 4 weeks in a randomized order, with a 2 week washout period between active therapies.
 Aerosols of 1 mumol/L and 3 mumol/L capsaicin and 0.68% citric acid in 0.9% NaCl were generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, and the frequency of cough was counted during inhalation.
 Delapril treatment resulted in substantially fewer patients with a significant increase (greater than or equal to 4 coughs during treatment than during the control period) in the frequency of cough than did captopril treatment.
 In the 1 and 4 week studies, enalapril and captopril had substantially more occurrences of significantly increased capsaicin-induced cough than did delapril.
 These results indicate that delapril has the least cough stimulatory effect among these ACE inhibitors, which may be clinically beneficial.

"Cardiorespiratory effects of endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy.
 Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension.
 While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS.
 Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events.
 Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics.
 Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant.
 Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety.
 Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature.
 Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.

"Catheter-based intravascular ultrasound imaging of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease.
 Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is now the treatment of choice for pulmonary hypertension due to chronic pulmonary thromboemboli.
 A precise assessment of location and extension of these thrombi is important because only proximal chronic pulmonary thromboemboli are accessible to surgery.
 Because intravascular ultrasound imaging can assess not only arterial luminal size, but also wall thickness, its value as a complement to angiography was assessed in 11 patients aged 35 to 64 years with severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure, mean +/- standard deviation 70 +/- 19 mm Hg; pulmonary artery resistance, 609 +/- 297 dynes.s.cm-5).
 Intravascular ultrasound was obtained in 10 of 11 patients and no complication occurred.
 Intravascular ultrasound identified 10 segments with suspected chronic pulmonary thromboemboli in 7 patients, all confirmed at operation.
 Nine segments were considered normal, all of which (except 1) were free of chronic pulmonary thromboemboli at operation.
 Image quality was highly dependent on pulmonary artery size and position of the catheter.
 Therefore, intravascular ultrasound of pulmonary arteries is feasible and safe in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
 It may help to assess the location and extension of the pathologic process involving pulmonary arteries.

 Acute pulmonary embolism with infarction can delay urgently needed heart transplantation and increase the postoperative pulmonary complications.
 Few data are available concerning pulmonary embolization in the pediatric patient with end-stage congestive heart failure.
 Sixty-two consecutive pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation were monitored for evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
 Acute pulmonary infarction was documented by ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography or pathologic examination in six patients.
 The prevalence differed by diagnosis; 5 of 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 of 20 patients with congenital heart disease developed acute pulmonary embolism with infarction.
 No significant difference in age at the time of transplantation evaluation, duration of congestive heart failure, presence of cardiac arrhythmias or degree of cardiac dysfunction was seen between patients with and without pulmonary embolism.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography failed to detect the presence of an intracardiac thrombus in four of the six patients.
 Two patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction are alive after successful heart transplantation.

 In summary, pediatric patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are at risk for acute pulmonary embolism.
 No specific clinical factor identified those patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction.
 Anticoagulant therapy is strongly recommended in the pediatric patient with poor ventricular function awaiting heart transplantation.

"Pulmonary sequestration: diagnosis with color Doppler sonography and a new theory of associated hydrothorax.
 The diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration has traditionally relied on angiographic demonstration of a systemic artery to the sequestered lung tissue.
 Rarely, extralobar sequestration can be associated with tension hydrothorax, which in the past has invariably led to fetal hydrops and death.
 The authors report the cases of three infants who had initially undergone color and spectral Doppler analysis; in two of them, extralobar sequestrations were associated with congenital hydrothorax.
 All three patients underwent surgical resection and histopathologic evaluation of their sequestrations.
 On the basis of the findings, the authors believe that torsion of the sequestration occludes the efferent venous and lymphatic channels, initiating the accumulation of pleural fluid and subsequent hydrops through systemic venous obstruction.
 Color Doppler made possible the identification of minute feeding vessels, obviating further diagnostic studies.

"Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients.
 Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated.
 Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia.
 However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both.
 The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs).

"Endobronchial actinomycosis simulating bronchogenic carcinoma. Diagnosis by bronchial biopsy.
 Five cases of actinomycosis of the main bronchi or trachea which were suggestive clinically of bronchogenic carcinoma are described.
 In four patients the correct diagnosis was made by a bronchial biopsy or wash, or both.
 Three of them recovered following antibiotic treatment, and one died a few days after bronchoscopy.
 In one case the Actinomyces were found in the bronchial wash retrospectively following diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis in the lobectomy specimen.
 A concomitant endobronchial lipoma was found in one of the patients.

"Urethral pressure and power generation during coughing and voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor in healthy females.
 A probe which permits continuous measurement of the related values of pressure and cross-sectional area in the female urethra was used to provide a quantitative description of the adjunctive occlusive forces in terms of pressure and power (mWatt) generation.
 Measurements were carried out at the bladder neck, midurethrally and distally in the urethra in 30 healthy women during coughing and squeezing.
 Statistically significant variations were found in pressure and power generation between the 3 sites of measurement both during coughing and squeezing.
 Power generation and the pressure increase were significantly greater during coughing than during squeezing along the entire length of the urethra.
 The presence of a dynamic active closure mechanism was demonstrated at the bladder neck in addition to that located midurethrally.
 This bladder neck mechanism is thought to be due to the vagino-levator sling system (the urethral supports).

"Effect of oral omeprazole on intragastric pH and volume in women undergoing elective caesarean section 
 We have studied in obstetric patients the efficacy of omeprazole in increasing intragastric pH to more than 2.5 and reducing volume to less than 25 ml.
 Omeprazole 40 mg was given orally the night before and again on the morning of surgery to 30 Asian women scheduled to undergo elective Caesarean section.
 After induction of anaesthesia, a gastric tube was inserted and intragastric contents aspirated.
 Volume and pH were recorded and measurements were repeated on completion of surgery.
 The median (range) volume was 2 (1-13) ml before surgery and 4 (0-14) ml at the end of surgery.
 There was insufficient volume to measure pH in all patients.
 The median (range) pH was 6.7 (4.6-7.4) before surgery in 20 patients and 6.6 (4.6-7.8) at the end of surgery in 28 patients.
 No adverse drug reactions were noted in mothers or neonates.
 Omeprazole 40 mg orally twice before elective Caesarean section appeared to be effective in reducing intragastric volume and acidity to acceptable values.

"Complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in neonates.
 In cases of severe respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary bypass has been used as support until cardiac and pulmonary recovery occurs.
 We report the Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its associated complications.
 From July 1985 to March 1989, 57 neonates were placed on membrane oxygenators.
 The overall survival was 79%.
 Technical complications encountered included catheter-related problems, mechanical complications of the pump apparatus, and hemorrhage.
 Hemorrhagic complications were the most frequent and devastating complications encountered.
 Intracranial hemorrhage accounted for six deaths associated with bypass.
 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is successful in significantly improving survival of neonates whose predicted mortality approaches 100% with conventional treatment.
 The rate of infant mortality using the membrane oxygenator is not affected by technical complications related to catheter position, mechanical problems with the circuit, or hemorrhage, excluding intracranial hemorrhage.
 The major cause of death of infants receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is the underlying disease process leading to cardiopulmonary failure.

"Prolonged venous infusion of cisplatin and concurrent radiation therapy for lung carcinoma. A feasibility study.
 Fifty patients with non resectable and/or inoperable bronchogenic carcinoma were entered into a feasibility study of cisplatin (CDDP) given in continuous infusion with concurrent radiation therapy.
 The radiation therapy regimen consisted of 2 Gy given 5 days a week in the first 3 and last 2 weeks of a 7-week split course (50 Gy of total dose).
 The CDDP (daily dose of 4 to 6 mg/m2) was administered to cover the days of radiation treatment by means of a central venous catheter and a portable pump.
 Less than 1% of predicted duration of infusion was lost due to complications related to venous access and pump.
 Toxicity was moderate.
 The overall probability of a locoregional major response (complete + partial) within 1 month after treatment completion was 86%.
 Twenty-three patients underwent resection.
 The 1-year actuarial probability of survival was 64%.

"Proximal esophageal pH-metry in patients with 'reflux laryngitis'.
 Fiberoptic laryngoscopic examinations were performed on 40 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, 25 of whom had persistent laryngeal symptoms (dysphonia, cough, globus sensation, frequent throat clearing, or sore throat) and 15 without laryngeal symptoms who served as disease controls.
 Ten patients with laryngeal symptoms but none of the controls had laryngoscopic findings consistent with reflux laryngitis.
 Dual-site ambulatory pH recordings were obtained with the pH electrodes spaced 15 cm apart and with the proximal sensor positioned just distal to the upper esophageal sphincter.
 Patients in the three groups (disease controls: group 1; patients with symptoms but without laryngoscopic findings: group 2; and patients with both laryngeal symptoms and findings: group 3) were comparable in terms of age, smoking habit, the presence of esophagitis, and distal esophageal acid exposure.
 Proximal esophageal acid exposure was, however, significantly increased in groups 2 and 3, and nocturnal proximal esophageal acidification occurred in over half of these patients but in none of the group 1 patients.
 We conclude that the subset of reflux patients who experience laryngeal symptoms show significantly more proximal esophageal acid exposure (especially nocturnally) and often have laryngoscopic findings of posterior laryngitis not observed in control reflux patients.

"Local and global function of the right ventricle in a canine model of pulmonary microembolism and oleic acid edema: influence of ventilation with PEEP.
 Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction may occur due to increased RV afterload and, hence, might also contribute to the decrease in cardiac output following institution of PEEP in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
 To test this hypothesis, the authors examined the influence of PEEP on local and global RV function in 12 anesthetized dogs with experimental ARDS (eARDS) induced by pulmonary microembolization with glass beads and oleic acid.
 Local RV function was analyzed in the RV inflow tract (RVIT) and RV outflow tract (RVOT) by assessing both diastolic segment length, systolic segment shortening, and segment work (sonomicrometry).
 Global RV contractility was quantified by measuring maximum rate of pressure rise (dRVP/dtmax) and maximum velocity of contractile element shortening (Vmax).
 In eARDS, despite a fivefold increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, there was no change in cardiac index (CI), global RV contractility, RVIT and RVOT work, and RVIT shortening, whereas RVOT shortening decreased from 12.4 to 7.4% (P less than 0.01).
 Diastolic segment length increased in RVIT (P less than 0.05) but not in RVOT.
 PEEP of 10 cmH2O did not alter global RV contractility, RVIT and RVOT shortening, and RVIT work but reduced RVOT work (-35%; P less than 0.01) and CI (-11%; P less than 0.001).
 Cardiac index further decreased during PEEP of 20 cmH2O (-38%; P less than 0.001), while global RV contractility remained intact despite decreased RVIT and RVOT shortening (-32% and -69%; P less than 0.05) and work (-26% and -59%; P less than 0.01) in the presence of reduced fiber preload in both regions.
 From these findings, it was concluded that 1) the decreased CI during mechanical ventilation with PEEP at constant right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) is not caused by depressed global RV contractility in dogs with eARDS and a normal myocardium prior to insult.
 Decreased diastolic segment length and segment shortening during PEEP suggest that 2) PEEP reduces stroke volume by the Starling mechanism rather than by ischemia of the RV free wall.
 Finally, regionally incongruent changes of fiber preload indicate that 3) local differences in RV wall compliance are likely to occur subsequent to eARDS and PEEP.

"Inverse ratio ventilation in ARDS. Rationale and implementation.
 Conventional ventilatory support of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) consists of volume-cycled ventilation with applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
 Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that this strategy, as currently implemented, may perpetuate lung damage by overinflating and injuring distensible alveolar tissues.
 An alternative strategy--termed inverse ratio ventilation (IRV)--extends the inspiratory time, and, in concept, maintains or improves gas exchange at lower levels of PEEP and peak distending pressures.
 There are two methods to administer IRV: (1) volume-cycled ventilation with an end-inspiratory pause, or with a slow or decelerating inspiratory flow rate; or (2) pressure-controlled ventilation applied with a long inspiratory time.
 There are several real or theoretical problems common to both forms of IRV: excessive gas-trapping; adverse hemodynamic effects; and the need for sedation in most patients.
 Although there are many anecdotal reports of IRV, there are no controlled studies that compare outcome in ARDS patients treated with IRV as opposed to conventional ventilation.
 Nonetheless, clinicians are using IRV with increasing frequency.
 In the absence of well-designed clinical trials, we present interim guidelines for a ventilatory strategy in patients with ARDS based on the literature and our own clinical experience.

"Persistence of antibody after accelerated immunisation with diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine.
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the persistence of antibody to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in children receiving an accelerated schedule of primary immunisation.
 DESIGN--Controlled study of antibody testing of blood samples from children immunised according to various schedules: three doses of triple vaccine completed at 8-13 calendar months, 6-7 calendar months, before 6 calendar months, or three doses followed by diphtheria/tetanus before age 2.
 SETTING--Plymouth Health Authority.
 SUBJECTS--129 children aged 4 years who had received three doses of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine with or without a diphtheria/tetanus booster.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin concentrations and antibody titres to pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutinin, and agglutinogens 2 and 3.
 RESULTS--All children had protective concentrations of antitoxin to diphtheria and tetanus (greater than or equal to 0.01 IU/ml).
 There was no evidence of a significant difference in diphtheria or tetanus antitoxin concentrations and pertussis antibody titres in children immunised with an accelerated course (third dose of triple vaccine before 6 months) compared with those who received a longer course (third dose at 8-13 months) with no booster (geometric mean antitoxin concentration 0.411 (95% confidence interval 0.273 to 0.618) v 0.426 (0.294 to 0.616) for diphtheria and 0.358 (0.231 to 0.556) v 0.299 (0.197 to 0.453) for tetanus; geometric mean antibody titres 903 (500 to 1631) v 1386 (848 to 2266) for pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin, 179 (130 to 248) v 232 (167 to 322) for pertussis toxin, and 2002 (1276 to 3142) v 3591 (2220 to 5809) for agglutinogens 2 and 3).
 CONCLUSION--Immunisation with three doses of triple vaccine at monthly intervals completed before 6 months of age probably provides adequate protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough which will persist until the age of the preschool booster.

"The necessary length of hospital stay for chronic pulmonary disease.
 OBJECTIVE.--To determine the necessary length of stay for patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease and to compare this with the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group system.
 DESIGN.--A cohort of patients were followed up prospectively after hospital admission to determine when complications, critical incidents, and the need for monitoring occurred.
 The medically derived necessary lengths of stay were statistically compared with the lengths of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group.
 Clinical factors were used to predict long vs short necessary lengths of stay.
 SETTING.--Two acute care hospitals: one was the principal and the other a major community teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS.--A consecutive sample of 83 patients who were 45 years of age or older and who required admission for treatment of chronic pulmonary disease.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The occurrence and time of complications, critical interventions, and monitoring.
 RESULTS.--After 6 days in the hospital, 90% of patients were free of complications or the need for monitoring.
 However, 16 days elapsed before 90% of patients had been discharged from the hospital.
 The length of stay that was considered necessary for care averaged 6.9 days; the actual mean length of stay was 8.7 days.
 The correlation between each patient's ideal length of stay and the length of stay assigned by the diagnosis related group was low and was not statistically significant.
 Three clinical variables at the time of admission (high PCO2 levels, symptoms that were present for more than 1 day, and antibiotic treatment) were associated with the need for longer hospital stays.
 CONCLUSIONS.--The medically required length of stay for patients with an exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease was between 6 and 7 days, on average.
 This length of stay, which was based on clinical events, differs from the length of stay that was calculated as a statistical norm by the diagnosis related group system.
 Clinical characteristics may help to identify patients who require a longer length of stay.

"Cough, exertional, and other miscellaneous headaches.
 We have discussed several miscellaneous headache disorders not associated with structural brain disease.
 The first group included those headaches provoked by ""exertional"" triggers in various forms.
 These include benign cough headache, BEH, and headache associated with sexual activity.
 The IHS diagnostic criteria were discussed.
 Benign exertional headache and cough headache were discussed together because of their substantial similarities.
 In general, BEH is characterized by severe, short-lived pain after coughing, sneezing, lifting a burden, sexual activity, or other similar brief effort.
 Structural disease of the brain or skull was the most important differential diagnosis for these disorders, with posterior fossa mass lesions being identified as the most common organic etiology.
 Magnetic resonance imaging with special attention to the posterior fossa and foramen magnum is the preferred method for evaluating these patients.
 Indomethacin is the treatment of choice.
 The headache associated with sexual activity is dull in the early phases of sexual excitement and becomes intense at orgasm.
 This headache is unpredictable in occurrence.
 Like BEH, the headache associated with sexual activity can be a manifestation of structural disease.
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage must be excluded, by CT scanning and CSF examination, in patients with the sexual headache.
 Benign headache associated with sexual activity has been successfully treated with indomethacin and beta-blockers.
 The second miscellaneous group of headache disorders includes those provoked by eating something cold or food additives, and by environmental stimuli.
 Idiopathic stabbing headache does not have a known trigger and appears frequently in migraineurs.
 Its occurrence may also herald the termination of an attack of cluster headache.
 Indomethacin treatment provides significant relief.
 Three headaches triggered by substances that are eaten were reviewed: ingestion of a cold stimulus, nitrate/nitrite-induced headache, and MSG-induced headache.
 For the most part, avoidance of these stimuli can prevent the associated headache.
 Lastly, we reviewed headache provoked by high altitude and hypoxia.
 The headache is part of the syndrome of AMS during its early or benign stage and the later malignant stage of HACE.
 The pain can be exacerbated by exercise.
 The best treatment is prevention via slow ascent and avoidance of respiratory depressants.
 Acetazolamide and dexamethasone have proved useful in preventing this syndrome.

 These compounds were also tested on the systemic arterial blood pressure of rats and dogs.
 KP-10614 was the most potent inhibitor of in vitro platelet aggregation induced by ADP with IC50 of 1 nM among the compounds studied in this report, and it also showed ex vivo effectiveness at doses much lower than the other three compounds.
 KP-10614 was also orally active.
 At oral doses of 25, 50 and 100 micrograms/kg, this new compound caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation in rats, whereas the other three compounds were effective only at 500 micrograms/kg or more.
 In addition, KP-10614 showed definite antithrombotic effects at a dose range of 0.1 to 1 microgram/kg i.v.

"Diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. Comparison of a plugged telescoping catheter with the protected specimen brush.
 Protected samples of lower respiratory tract secretions processed by quantitative culture techniques are recommended to diagnose nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients.
 To evaluate the accuracy of a simple and inexpensive sampling device in this setting, we compared quantitative cultures of paired single-sheathed plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) and protected specimen brush (PSB) samples in 55 patients during 78 suspected episodes of nosocomial pneumonia.
 PTC and PSB samples were taken in randomized order, and patients were also randomized to have PTC samples taken ""blindly"" or via a fiberoptic bronchoscope.
 Fifteen PSB and 27 PTC samples were culture positive (greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml).
 The two sampling procedures gave similar results in 58 (74%) episodes.
 A major discrepancy occurred in 20 episodes, including six false negatives of PSB in episodes of proved pneumonia, four possible false positives of PSB, and 10 possible false positives of PTC (three of which rapidly evolved towards overt pneumonia).
 The sensitivity and specificity of PTC were 100 and 82.2%, and those of PSB were 64.7 and 93.5%, respectively.
 Blinded or directed PTC samples had similar concordance with PSB samples taken via bronchoscopy.
 We conclude that PTC is at least as accurate as PSB in the bacteriologic diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in intubated patients, and that its use can result in substantial cost savings, especially when fiberoptic bronchoscopy is not otherwise indicated.

"The effect of hyperventilation in cluster headache patients.
 The effect of voluntary hyperventilation was assessed in 22 cluster headache patients (8 in a cluster period and 14 in a remission) and 19 healthy individuals.
 Using an ear oximeter and a capnograph with a nasal probe, the oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the end-tidal CO2 were monitored continuously.
 During the hyperventilation per se, cluster headache patients and controls showed absolute values of end-tidal CO2 and of SaO2 of the same order of magnitude.
 In the posthyperventilation phase, however, the average of the lowest SaO2 levels was lower in controls than in cluster headache patients.
 In the posthyperventilation phase, headache patients outside the cluster period showed a trend more similar to that of the controls with respect to SaO2 than did those inside the cluster period.
 The observed discrepancy might, if reproducible, be a consequence of an altered chemoreceptor sensitivity in cluster headache patients during the bout.

"Cerebral venous thrombosis: new causes for an old syndrome?
 The range of disorders affecting the cerebral veins and sinuses is increasing and now includes blood disorders, abnormalities in the patterns of blood flow, and infiltrative or inflammatory conditions, all of which may promote thrombosis.

 There was no postoperative worsening of dyspnoea despite a mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 60% predicted for the patients undergoing surgery and of 20% predicted for two patients with severe restrictive defects, perhaps owing to the fact that there was little or no function in the resected part of the lung, as shown by preoperative isotope ventilation-perfusion scanning, and that patients were under the age of 50 and generally fit.

"Effect of antitumor surgery on soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels.
 Surgically induced immunosuppression may play a role in cancer, because of the possible existence of micrometastases at the time of surgical removal of tumors.
 Antitumor immune reactions are mediated by interleukin-2 (IL-2).
 IL-2 acts on a specific IL-2 cell surface receptor; moreover, a soluble form of IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) can be released in the blood.
 This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of surgery on sIL-2R serum levels in patients with operable solid tumors.
 A total of 48 patients with cancer and 11 controls who underwent major surgery for non-neoplastic disease were evaluated before and 7 days after surgery.
 Serum mean levels of sIL-2R were significantly higher after than before surgery in both the cancer and control groups.
 No correlation was seen between surgery-induced changes in sIL-2R and in T lymphocyte subsets.
 Because of its capacity of binding to IL-2, the increased blood concentrations of sIL-2R could reduce the IL-2 availability and negatively affect antitumor immune reactions.

"Sequential appearance of IL-1 and IL-6 activities in rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy.
 IL-1 and IL-6 activities were measured in the pleural exudate of rats during carrageenin-induced pleurisy to examine the relationship of the local production of cytokines to the inflammatory reaction.
 Time courses of appearance of the cytokines and inflammatory parameters in the exudate were compared.
 IL-1 activity and exudate volume started to increase at 1 h after the carrageenin injection, and then slightly later IL-6 activity and leukocyte number began to increase.
 IL-1 showed peak activity of approximately 700 U at 3 h and IL-6, of 6000 U at 5 h in the exudate, whereas exudate volume and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes continued to increase thereafter.
 Furthermore, IL-6 level in the plasma of the carrageenin-injected rats showed a peak at 4 h (30 U/ml), and when rhIL-1 alpha (100,000 U) was intrapleurally injected, the more rapid increase in plasma IL-6 level was demonstrated at 1 h (30 U/ml).
 This latter rise was neutralized with simultaneous injection of anti-rhIL-1 alpha antibody.
 These facts indicate the possibility that IL-1 produced in the exudate or injected could rapidly propagate a signal to induce IL-6 production in the circulation.
 It took several hours to transmit an inflammatory signal that stimulated the liver to synthesize the acute-phase protein, T-kininogen.
 The time lag from the peak induction of IL-1 to the T-kininogen-increase in the pleurisy corresponded well to the interval for T-kininogen-increase by exogenous rhIL-1 alpha injection.
 These results strongly suggest that the initial inflammatory stimulus induces sequentially IL-1, IL-6, and T-kininogen production in this carrageenin inflammation.

"A mouse model for investigating the molecular pathogenesis of adenovirus pneumonia.
 Intranasal inoculation of type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) produced pneumonia in mice even though the virus did not replicate.
 To induce the pneumonia, however, a large viral infectious dose was required--i.e., 10(10) plaque-forming units.
 Four strains of inbred mouse were studied (C57BL/6N, C57BL/10ScN, CBA/N, and C3H/N): all showed similar inflammatory responses, although the greatest infiltration occurred in the C57BL/6N mice.
 The pathological response to Ad5 infection resembled that previously described in cotton rats: it consisted of overlapping early and late phases, and the infiltration contained primarily lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages with a scattering of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
 The prominent early phase and the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggested that induction of cytokines may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this pneumonia.
 Assays showed the appearance of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and IL-6 in the infected mouse lungs concomitant with the developing early-phase infiltration.
 Only IL-6 was found in the peripheral blood.
 IL-6 reached maximum titers 6-24 hr after infection, whereas maximum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 were attained 2-3 days after infection.
 Specific RNAs for each of these cytokines were demonstrated in the infected lungs.
 To test the hypothesis that a cytotoxic T-cell response was responsible for the second phase, which primarily consisted of a perivascular and peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes, Ad5 was used to infect C57BL/10ScN Nu/Nu and parent mice.
 The nude mice showed a normal early-phase response, but essentially no peribronchial and only minimal perivascular infiltrations occurred.

"Prediction of maximum exercise tolerance in patients with COPD 
 Exercise tolerance in patients with COPD is difficult to predict from measurements of lung function.
 We examined multiple physiologic and psychosocial variables in an attempt to predict exercise performance in a group of patients with COPD enrolled in a clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation.
 A total of 119 patients (FEV1 = 1.41 +/- 0.64 L) were divided randomly into either a study group (group A, n = 58) or validation group (group B, n = 61).
 Stepwise multiple regression in group A revealed that peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) was predicted best by the following equation: Peak VO2 (L/min) = (0.0327 x DCO) + (0.0040 x MVV)-(0.0156 x peak-exercise VD/VT) + (0.0259 x resting VE) + 0.848; r = 0.90; SE = 0.233 L/min.
 This equation was then cross-validated in group B.
 It demonstrated excellent validity: measured peak VO2 (L/min) = (1.13 x predicted peak VO2)-0.0891; r = 0.90; SE = 0.239 L/min.
 We conclude that exercise tolerance was predicted reasonably well from measurements of lung function and gas exchange in this group of patients with COPD.
 However, the variability of the prediction would limit its usefulness in individual patients.

 This study aimed to define the incidence and severity of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), as measured using 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring, in 38 infants with recurrent respiratory symptoms and to relate these findings to measures of respiratory function.
 Twenty one infants had a pH under 4 for more than 5% of the time (one definition of abnormal GOR) and nine had GOR exceeding age related normal values.
 Maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity was reduced in 37 infants, airways resistance was raised in 19 infants, and thoracic gas volume was abnormal in 11 infants.
 There was no association between indices of GOR and measures of lung function whether assessed by correlation or by chi 2 analysis for normal versus abnormal values.
 However, individual infants appeared to have respiratory symptoms produced by GOR.
 This suggests that host responsiveness to GOR may be of greater relevance than the amount of GOR.

"High-dose carmustine and autologous bone marrow reinfusion in the treatment of refractory or relapsed small cell lung carcinoma.
 Fourteen patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung in relapse or with disease refractory to chemotherapy were treated with carmustine (BCNU) at doses of 600 to 1000 mg/m2 intravenously followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation.
 All patients previously were treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide.
 Seven of the 14 patients responded to the high-dose BCNU (50% response with 95% confidence limits ranging from 23% to 77%).
 Three patients had a complete response, and four had a partial response.
 Regrowth of tumor occurred within 60 days of treatment in the responding patients.
 Death occurred in six patients before the recovery of the platelet count to 50,000 cells/microliters.
 Although the response rate was high, the toxicity was excessive.
 In the dosage range of 600 to 1000 mg/m2 in heavily pretreated patients, BCNU is not recommended, but additional investigation may be warranted in patients with central nervous system metastases who previously were treated with radiation therapy.

"Effusion cytology.
 Cytologic evaluation is the best way to detect the presence of malignancy in body cavity fluids.
 Although a positive diagnosis is highly reliable, a negative result does not rule out a malignant cause.
 Adenocarcinomas, well-differentiated squamous carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, large-cell lymphomas, and acute leukemias are accurately classified when present in effusions.
 The definitive diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, small-cell lymphomas, and chronic leukemias, and subclassification of sarcomas and poorly differentiated neoplasms are difficult and may require additional diagnostic techniques.
 With a few exceptions, the exact causes of benign effusions cannot be determined by cytologic methods.

"A simple method for correcting single breath total lung capacity for underestimation.
 The single breath method underestimates total lung capacity by comparison with the multiple breath method (TLCmb) because of inhomogeneity of ventilation distribution.
 This study proposes a simple correction for the single breath TLC (TLCsb), using inert gas phase III slope to account for the effects of uneven ventilation distribution.
 A model of a non-uniform lung ventilation was designed, composed of a serial dead space and two alveolar compartments arranged in parallel, whose relative ventilations were determined from the phase III plateau.
 Before correction TLCsb was 104-44% of TLCmb in 64 subjects (17 with diffuse interstitial disease, 42 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and five healthy subjects).
 The limit of acceptability for the correction (TLCcorr) was determined from the 95% confidence interval of TLCsb/TLCmb in the healthy subjects.
 The correction resulted in a significant increase in TLCsb (p less than 0.004).
 TLCcorr remained under the limit of acceptability for only 12 patients with emphysema, and all 12 showed a large improvement in the TLC estimate.
 The presence of poorly ventilated zones during a single breath in these patients may explain this partial correction.

"Respiratory problems in emergence from anesthesia.
 In conclusion, anesthesia and mechanical ventilation have major effects on respiratory function, both intraoperatively and postoperatively.
 Recognition that mechanical ventilation represents a major departure from spontaneous ventilation should enable anesthesiologists to compensate for the increases in dead space ventilation and the propensity for alveolar collapse that accompany low volume mechanical ventilation.
 The use of postoperative regional analgesic techniques to alleviate respiratory compromise constitutes both current clinical practice and an area of active, ongoing investigation.
 Gone are the days when the anesthesiologist's responsibility stopped at the recovery room door.
 Today, anesthesiologists with expertise in postoperative pain management, cardiovascular physiology, and intensive ventilatory care are able to provide patients an improved likelihood of avoiding postoperative respiratory complications.

"Direct injury to the bronchial vasculature in anesthetized sheep.
 Injury to the bronchial vasculature may contribute to liquid and solute leakage into the lung during noncardiac pulmonary edema.
 The purpose of this study was to measure changes in hemodynamics, pulmonary mechanics, extravascular lung water, and lung morphometry after selectively injuring the bronchial vasculature in anesthetized sheep.
 In two groups of seven sheep, we injected oleic acid (0.1 ml/kg) or normal saline directly into the bronchoesophageal artery.
 We measured systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac output, oxygen saturation, pulmonary resistance and compliance, and lung volumes before and 1 and 4 h after injection.
 The lungs were removed for measurement of extravascular water, histology, and morphometry.
 Four hours after injection of oleic acid, cardiac output decreased but pulmonary arterial pressure did not change.
 In addition, pulmonary resistance increased and dynamic compliance and vital capacity decreased.
 Extravascular lung water was slightly but significantly greater in the oleic acid group.
 Histological examination showed interstitial edema and leukocytes in airway walls and sloughing of bronchial epithelium but little or no alveolar edema.
 Morphometric analysis showed significant thickening of airway walls.
 We conclude that direct injury to the bronchial vasculature increases lung resistance, decreases dynamic compliance, and increases extravascular lung water by the accumulation of an inflammatory infiltrate in airway walls.

 Patients were initially stabilized on CPPV and then switched to APRV.
 The APRV provided effective ventilatory support in 17 of 18 patients; APRV achieved similar levels of alveolar ventilation as CPPV (for APRV, mean PaCO2 = 45.0 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; vs for CPPV, mean PaCO2 = 43.3 +/- 5.7 mm Hg), with significantly lower mean maximum airway pressures (38.9 +/- 10.1 cm H2O vs 64.6 +/- 15.4 cm H2O; p = 0.0001) and mean VT (0.79 +/- 0.11 L vs 1.05 +/- 0.15 L; p = 0.0002).

"Immune responses to Bordetella pertussis infection and vaccination.
 To assess antibody and cellular immune responses, 156 healthy children were immunized at approximately 18 months of age with acellular diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine.
 Changes in antibody responses to filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and to pertussis toxin (PT) were similar in pattern, and antibody titers reached values equal to those from patients with convalescent-stage pertussis.
 The FHA-induced DNA synthesis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was maximum at 4 weeks after the primary series, and these levels were equal to those of patients with pertussis.
 High amounts of PT-induced DNA synthesis were observed in both immunized and nonimmunized children; thus, PT seemed to act mainly as a nonspecific mitogen.
 Almost the same responses to several mitogens that activate different subsets of lymphocytes were observed in young infants compared with older children.
 Furthermore, young infants who had Bordetella pertussis infection responded by FHA stimulation almost as well as older children.

"Inspiratory flow dynamics during mechanical ventilation in patients with respiratory failure.
 We studied the effect of inspiratory flow rate on respiratory resistance during mechanical ventilation in 15 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF).
 Resistance was measured by both constant flow inflation and occlusion methods as inspiratory flow rates were increased from 0.66 to 2.0 L/s.
 Endotracheal tube resistance was subtracted from total resistance to obtain respiratory resistance.
 In contrast to the flow-dependent increase in endotracheal tube resistance, respiratory resistance decreased continuously as flow rate and airway pressure increased, except in four of six patients with asthma in whom respiratory resistance increased as flow increased.
 Mechanical airway dilatation, tissue resistance, stress relaxation, and time-constant inequalities may contribute to the decrease in respiratory resistance.
 In status asthmaticus, however, the effects of turbulence, noncompliant airways, and/or ""reflex"" bronchoconstriction may be sufficient to cause a flow-dependent increase in resistance.

"Tumor necrosis factor production in HIV-seropositive subjects. Relationship with lung opportunistic infections and HIV expression in alveolar macrophages.
 We have evaluated the TNF production by alveolar macrophages (AM) in 43 HIV-infected subjects in relation with 1) their clinical and biologic status; 2) the presence of lung opportunistic infections (OI); and 3) the expression of HIV by AM.
 This production was assessed in a standard chromium release test, using monocytic U937 cells as targets.
 The spontaneous TNF production by AM from patients without lung OI was higher than that from seronegative controls (p less than 0.02).
 This production by AM was similar to that of blood monocytes, suggesting that it was not related, in these subjects, to any particular lung status.
 The extent of TNF release by AM was correlated to the presence of a lymphocytic alveolitis (p less than 0.05), and not to the patients' clinical presentation nor to their CD4 cell count.
 Finally, AM from these subjects could be normally stimulated in vitro by IFN-gamma.
 On the other hand, it appeared that the spontaneous TNF release by AM shown in vitro to express HIV (p24+ AM) was significantly higher than that by their p24- counterparts (p less than 0.05) and by controls (p less than 0.01).
 In addition, contrasting with the marked increase of TNF release by p24- AM after their stimulation with IFN-gamma (p less than 0.001), p24+ AM appeared to be refractory to any stimulation by IFN, arguing for their activation in vivo.
 Finally, the spontaneous TNF release by AM was significantly increased during lung OI, compared with controls (p less than 0.01) as well as with AIDS patients without OI (p less than 0.01).
 In addition, the production of TNF by AM in these subjects was higher than that by the corresponding blood monocytes (p less than 0.02), suggesting a compartmentalization of this response within the lungs.
 In conclusion, it appears that the TNF production by AM of seropositive patients is highly related to the presence of lung OI as well as to the expression of HIV by these cells.
 In the context of the up-regulation of HIV expression induced by TNF in vitro, our data could suggest that the in vivo release of TNF by AM could participate in viral dissemination.
 Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation of activated AM refractory to any further stimulation could in turn lead to the development of additional pulmonary infections.

 Patients with P.
 carinii pneumonia and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were asked to participate in this study.
 All patients had P.
 carinii identified on methenamine silver stain of BAL fluid.
 BAL fluid was also stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa technique.
 The Wright-Giemsa stain was done to determine the cell differential count, and the number of P.

 carinii burden in the BAL.
 Initial and follow-up lavage was performed in 56 patients.
 Patients were classified based on their clinical response to anti-P.

 Nonresponders were patients with persistent or worsening symptoms.
 Responders were patients who improved and had therapy discontinued.
 Responders were further classified as responders with relapse if P.

"Contractile properties of the human diaphragm during chronic hyperinflation 
 BACKGROUND.
 In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hyperinflation of the lungs, dysfunction of the diaphragm may contribute to respiratory decompensation.
 We evaluated the contractile function of the diaphragm in well-nourished patients with stable COPD, using supramaximal, bilateral phrenic-nerve stimulation, which provides information about the strength and inspiratory action of the diaphragm.
 METHODS.
 In eight patients with COPD and five control subjects of similar age, the transdiaphragmatic pressure generated by the twitch response to phrenic-nerve stimulation was recorded at various base-line lung volumes, from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity, and during relaxation and graded voluntary efforts at functional residual capacity (twitch occlusion).
 RESULTS.
 At functional residual capacity, the twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure ranged from 10.9 to 26.6 cm of water (1.07 to 2.60 kPa) in the patients and from 19.8 to 37.1 cm of water (1.94 to 3.64 kPa) in the controls, indicating considerable overlap between the two groups.
 The ratio of esophageal pressure to twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure, an index of the inspiratory action of the diaphragm, was -0.50 +/- 0.05 in the patients, as compared with -0.43 +/- 0.02 in the controls (indicating more efficient inspiratory action in the patients than in the controls).
 At comparable volumes, the twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure and esophageal-to-transdiaphragmatic pressure ratio were higher in the patients than in normal subjects, indicating that the strength and inspiratory action of the diaphragm in the patients were actually better than in the controls.
 Twitch occlusion (a measure of the maximal activation of the diaphragm) indicated near-maximal activation in the patients with COPD, and the maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure was 106.9 +/- 13.8 cm of water (10.48 +/- 1.35 kPa).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The functioning of the diaphragms of the patients with stable COPD is as good as in normal subjects at the same lung volume.
 Compensatory phenomena appear to counterbalance the deleterious effects of hyperinflation on the contractility and inspiratory action of the diaphragm in patients with COPD.
 Our findings cast doubt on the existence of chronic fatigue of the diaphragm in such patients and therefore on the need for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving diaphragm function.

"Sarcoidosis complicated by HIV infection: three case reports and a review of the literature.
 We report three cases of sarcoidosis complicated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and review four other isolated case reports in the literature.
 There is clinical overlap of both diseases, including symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities, and lymphocyte function.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in these patients showed a lymphocytic alveolitis without pathogens.
 BAL lymphocyte subset analysis showed markedly depressed CD4+/CD8+ ratios in three patients.
 These data were clinically useful for distinguishing the CD8+ alveolitis associated with HIV infection from the CD4+ alveolitis associated with sarcoidosis.
 Three patients improved with corticosteroid therapy.
 Two patients with BAL-documented CD8+ alveolitis tolerated discontinuation of steroids.
 One patient's sarcoidosis improved without therapy concurrent with the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma.
 Another patient developed sarcoidosis 1 yr after manifesting HIV positive serology.

 The native proteins had an apparent mol wt of 290,000 or greater, based on molecular sieve studies as well as cross-linking studies.
 Both proteins were glycoproteins; treatment with endoglycosidase H resulted in a 9% decrease in mol wt.
 The carbohydrate composition of the rat P.

"Study design considerations for ribavirin: efficacy studies.
 Five placebo-controlled double-blind studies, each including approximately 30 subjects, have addressed the question of the effect of aerosolized ribavirin on the course of RSV lower respiratory infection in infancy.
 The fact that each was able to establish a beneficial effect despite the small number of subjects studied is convincing evidence that such an effect exists.

 These tools are reliable and easily applicable measures for multicenter studies when illness severity is selected as an outcome measure.
 Characteristics that should be taken into consideration when assigning experimental groups include age, sex, a history of prematurity or underlying conditions and arterial oxygen saturation.
 Future studies will address additional questions about the efficacy of ribavirin, such as its role in critically ill children, the economic benefits of its use in terms of duration of hospitalization, the usefulness of early treatment of RSV disease in high risk infants, and the impact of treatment on long-term consequences of RSV infection.

"Fungal tracheobronchitis. Report of 9 cases and review of the literature.
 Clinical, roentgenographic and pathologic findings are described in 9 patients with fungal tracheobronchitis and comparison is made with 25 additional cases in the literature.
 Two morphologic patterns were identified: the first appears as a pseudomembrane of necrotic tissue, exudate, and fungal hyphae involving more-or-less the entire circumference of the bronchial wall or as mucus/fungus plugs completely occluding the airway lumen; the second consists of single or multiple discrete plaques on the airway wall, sometimes associated with invasion of the adjacent lung parenchyma or pulmonary artery.
 As with more invasive forms of fungal infection, a compromise in host defenses is probably the most important factor leading to fungal colonization and subsequent local invasion.
 Malignancies of the hematologic and lymphoreticular systems, solid neoplasms, granulocytopenia, and a history of a protracted course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy were present in most of our patients and in those reported in the literature.
 Despite this, there is some evidence that tracheobronchitis may occur in individuals with a relatively lesser degree of host defense impairment.
 Local damage to the airway wall such as occurs with prolonged mechanical ventilatory support, neoplastic infiltration, or nonfungal infection may also be a factor predisposing to fungal colonization and invasion.
 In 4 of our patients, the fungal infection of the tracheobronchial tree probably contributed significantly to the development of terminal respiratory failure.
 Although recognition of the infection may not have altered the course of the underlying disease in some of our patients, in others identification and early treatment might have been life-saving.
 Thus, culture and histologic examination of bronchoscopically identified tracheobronchial mucus plugs and necrotic material should be performed in all immunocompromised individuals.

 Cytology was performed three times: (1) at thoracotomy, (2) immediately after resection, and (3) after washing the pleural cavity with 5,000 mL of physiological saline solution just before closure of the chest wall.
 Twenty-three patients (14%) had more than one positive cytological finding.
 The frequency of positive cytological findings was significantly correlated with pathological T classification, pleural status, and pathological stage.

 The positive cytological finding of pleural lavage has more important meaning as a prognostic factor in stage I and stage II and indicates a greater possibility of recurrence in pleura or pericardium, but further examinations to evaluate the viability of detected malignant cells are required so that the positive cytological findings of pleural lavage can be regarded as subclinical pleural dissemination.

"The use of fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of metastatic pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma.
 Nine patients with a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) arising in the head and neck and in whom transthoracic fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was performed to investigate pulmonary lesions are described.
 FNA yielded a definitive diagnosis of metastatic ACC in all cases.
 In six of the nine patients, the pulmonary metastases were asymptomatic.
 Lung lesions were discovered up to 19 years after primary tumor presentation, and in two, pulmonary spread was the only evidence of recurrent disease.
 On the basis of the FNA diagnosis, these two patients were treated surgically for their isolated pulmonary metastases, and are disease free at 107 and 139 months.
 Six of the nine patients received radiation or chemotherapy; one initially refused treatment.
 Thoracotomy was avoided in these patients on the basis of the FNA diagnosis.
 All are alive with disease at 25 to 246 months.
 The metastatic tumors were indistinguishable cytologically from two primary pulmonary ACCs that were available for comparison.
 Our experience suggests FNA is a useful tool in the diagnosis of ACC in pulmonary material--one which obviates the need for thoracotomy with its associated morbidity.

"Determinants of cell type in patients with cancer of the lungs.
 In order to evaluate the determinants of cell type in patients with primary lung cancer, we compared smoking characteristics in 1,939 patients (1,474 men and 465 women).
 Patients with squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, or small-cell carcinomas were eligible.
 This study did not consider smoking as a risk factor for lung cancer, as all subjects had a confirmed diagnosis.
 We were interested in smoking history and the pattern of smoking among those whose risk was 100 percent.
 Among these patients, we confirmed that a larger subset of nonsmoking individuals developed adenocarcinomas than squamous cell or small-cell carcinomas; however, the duration and intensity of cigarette smoking, as measured by pack-years, were not determinants of tumor cell type in male patients.
 Small-cell carcinomas in women were more strongly associated with cigarette smoking than either squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas.
 More than 3,500 different substances have been measured in tobacco smoke, including tumor initiators, promoters, and those involved in tumor progression.
 These data confirm the hypothesis that factors other than cigarette smoking are more likely to be involved in the initiation of adenocarcinomas than other cell types.
 Endogenous and exogenous factors related to gender may be more important than the duration or intensity of cigarette smoking.

"Treatment of meningitis and other infections due to ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b in children.
 Cefotaxime and other cephalosporins were retrospectively evaluated for the treatment of meningitis and non-central nervous system (CNS) infections due to ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).
 Between January 1985 and February 1989, 45 cases of meningitis and 27 cases of non-CNS infection due to ampicillin-resistant Hib were documented at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.
 Of the 45 children with meningitis, 26 (57.8%) were treated with cefotaxime, 11 (24.4%) with chloramphenicol, and three (6.7%) with cefuroxime; five children (11.1%) were initially given chloramphenicol but later received cefotaxime instead.
 In addition, 14 chloramphenicol-treated patients from a previous study were included in this analysis.
 There were no significant differences in terms of neurologic sequelae or other complications (except diarrhea) between the cefotaxime and chloramphenicol groups.
 The efficacy of cefotaxime was equivalent to that of chloramphenicol for the treatment of ampicillin-resistant Hib meningitis.
 Cefuroxime was as safe and effective as chloramphenicol or cefotaxime for the treatment of non-CNS infections due to ampicillin-resistant Hib.

"Differential roles of opioid receptors in respiration, respiratory disease, and opiate-induced respiratory depression.
 In summary, these findings indicate the importance of designing future experiments that delineate between opioid and nonopioid forms of respiratory disease and dysfunction, and the need to identify means of diagnosing them in order to achieve successful recovery.
 Apparently there is great diversity between animal species in terms of contributions of endogenous opioids to tonic control of ventilation, and future work should strive to identify which species is most appropriate as a model of human ventilatory control and disease.
 Certain opioid receptor types appear to be linked to independent respiratory functions.
 For instance, mu receptors in the brain stem produce strong inhibitory actions on respiratory parameters, including RR, VT, VE, and CO2 sensitivity.
 These effects have been observed in vivo and by electrophysiologic recordings in vitro.
 Delta receptors may also exert some inhibitory effect on respiration, especially in the NTS.
 In the CNS, the ventral surfaces of the medulla and pons, especially the NTS and NA, seem to be important sites for opioid-induced inhibition of respiration, whereas the spinal cord probably is not involved in opioid-mediated ventilatory depression.
 Kappa receptors appear to be devoid of respiratory depressant activity, whereas sigma receptors may stimulate some ventilatory parameters.
 Morphine and similar pure mu agonists, such as fentanyl and oxymorphine, probably produce their analgesic and respiratory depressant effects through stimulation of mu receptors.
 Mixed agonists/antagonists that have mu antagonist (or partial agonist) activity plus kappa agonist and/or sigma agonist activity show a ceiling effect for respiratory depression.
 Future tests need to determine which opioid receptor may be responsible for the ceiling effect.
 In addition, the effects of mu, delta, kappa, and sigma selective agonists on hypoxic drive should also be determined, as a drug that stimulates hypoxic sensitivity in the face of hypercapnic depression may produce less overall respiratory depression due to counteractive effects.
 In the future, clinically optimal opiates should have more specificity of action than those available now.
 This may be achieved by creating drugs selective for single receptors or by creating drugs with desirable combinations of receptor selectivities.
 The combinations of mixed agonists/antagonists with pure mu agonists currently in use today are promising, as they provide analgesia with reduced respiratory depression.
 In the early days of opiate research and development, combination drug regimens were thoroughly tested to determine the ""ideal ratios"" that would retain analgesic properties but not the other undesirable effects such as respiratory depression (196).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

"Control of local blood flow in pulmonary inflammation: role for neutrophils, PAF, and thromboxane.
 The intrapulmonary instillation of C5a results in a local inflammatory response that, in this site, is accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow.
 Reversal of this decrease by vasodilators or the thromboxane synthesis inhibitor dazmegral has been shown to result in enhanced lung inflammation.
 In the present study the mechanisms underlying the decrease in flow in pulmonary inflammation were investigated in the rabbit in vivo and in the isolated blood-perfused rabbit lung.
 In vivo, the decrease in local blood flow was shown to be dependent on circulating neutrophils.
 In the isolated blood-perfused lung, inflammation induced by airway instillation of C5a was similar histologically to that seen in vivo and was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow.
 The decrease in blood flow appeared to require circulating neutrophils and was prevented by dazmegral and the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB 2086 and L-659,989.
 Furthermore, no decrease occurred in aspirin-treated lungs perfused with normal blood, suggesting that the source of thromboxane was lung rather than circulating cells.
 The decrease in blood flow in inflammation did not appear to be a consequence of hypoxic vasoconstriction.
 Inflammation in the guinea pig lung was also accompanied by a decrease in local blood flow and was also prevented by dazmegral and PAF antagonists.
 We conclude that local inflammation in the lung is accompanied by a decrease in blood flow that involves neutrophils and the lipid mediators PAF and thromboxane.
 We suggest that this form of negative feedback by the neutrophil serves to control the inflammatory response.

"The role of leukotrienes in allergic rhinitis: a review.
 Leukotrienes are potent proinflammatory mediators.
 Our understanding of their role in allergic rhinitis has increased, but further, extensive investigation is required.
 The sulfidopeptide LTs are generated during the immediate response to antigen provocation and are probably increased during the late inflammatory phase and during seasonal exposure.
 The source of LTC4 in the early allergic reaction includes the mast cell, but other cell types may also contribute.
 LTD4 causes nasal congestion and increased blood flow, but not sneezing or significant rhinorrhea.
 Studies in which LT generation was pharmacologically reduced support a role for these mediators in allergic rhinitis.
 There is now a need to evaluate the more potent, recently developed, LT antagonists in rhinitis.
 These agents should help establish the relative importance of LTs to the many other inflammatory mediators that are implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis.
 Such knowledge will broaden and improve our choice of therapeutic modalities for this disease.

 The particles were congregated in the walls of blood vessels and in perivascular fibrous zones, consistent with a causal role of Thorotrast in the development of lung fibrosis.

"Analysis of the hemodynamic and ventilatory effects of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy uses carbon dioxide, a highly diffusable gas, for insufflation.
 With extended periods of insufflation, patient arterial carbon dioxide levels may be adversely altered.
 Patients were selected for laparoscopic cholecystectomy using the same criteria as for open cholecystectomy.
 Twenty patients (group 1) had normal preoperative cardiopulmonary status (American Society of Anesthesiologists class I), while 10 patients (group 2) had previously diagnosed cardiac or pulmonary disease (class II or III).
 Demographic, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas, and ventilatory data were collected before peritoneal insufflation and at intervals during surgery.
 Patients with preoperative cardiopulmonary disease demonstrated significant increases in arterial carbon dioxide levels and decreases in pH during carbon dioxide insufflation compared with patients without underlying disease.
 Results of concurrent noninvasive methods of assessing changes in partial arterial pressures of carbon dioxide (end-tidal carbon dioxide measured with mass spectrographic techniques) may be misleading and misinterpreted because changes in partial arterial pressures of carbon dioxide are typically much smaller than changes in arterial blood levels and, unlike arterial gas measurements, do not indicate the true level of arterial hypercarbia.
 During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease may require careful intraoperative arterial blood gas monitoring of absorbed carbon dioxide.

 This pilot study assessed the urinary fibrinopeptide A (uFPA) levels and the combination of uFPA test plus ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).
 One hundred consecutive patients were studied prospectively.
 Twenty-nine patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria defined in this study (seven with and 22 without PE).
 The uFPA concentration was significantly higher in patients with than without PE (41.1 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 2.5 ng/mg of creatinine, p less than 0.0001).
 In all patients with PE, the uFPA levels were higher than threshold value derived by adding 2 standard deviations to the mean uFPA concentration of patients without PE.
 In patients without PE, the V/Q scan was negative in 16, the uFPA test was negative in 18, and at least one of the tests was negative in 21.
 These preliminary data suggest that a negative uFPA test may be helpful in excluding PE and that uFPA in combination with V/Q lung scans may correctly exclude PE in more patients than either test alone.
 Further studies in a large unselected population are needed to confirm these results.

"Intermittent short-term negative pressure ventilation and increased oxygenation in COPD patients with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure.
 With the aim of testing a method that allows increasing concentrations of oxygen to be administered to patients with severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia while avoiding the risk of increasing respiratory acidosis, we studied 17 male patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hypercapnic respiratory failure.
 During 6 h and on one day only, all patients were given intermittent negative pressure ventilation (INPV) together with oxygenation starting at a concentration of 24 percent and increasing to 30 percent.
 Using this procedure, it was possible to raise arterial PaO2 to safe levels (from 47.2 +/- 3 mm Hg to 61.5 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) without increasing hypercapnia, and a significant drop in PaCO2 levels (from 74.4 +/- 9 mm Hg to 65.6 +/- 12 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) was even observed.
 One hour after INPV ended, the mean values of PaO2, PaCO2, oxygen saturation, and pH were also significantly better than prestudy values.

 To obtain accurate information on distal bronchial microflora during acute exacerbation in patients with chronic bronchitis, we prospectively studied 54 such patients who had been receiving mechanical ventilation because of hypercapnic respiratory failure.
 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) was performed on each patient within the first 24 h after admission.
 Cultures of protected brush specimens demonstrated no growth in 27 patients (50%).
 With the exception of fever (38.2 +/- 0.8 versus 37.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C; p less than 0.05), the initial severity of the episode of exacerbation was similar in patients with and without infection.
 A total of 44 organisms were isolated in the 27 patients with positive cultures; the predominant pathogens were Hemophilus spp.

"Serum and lavage lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar space.
 Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) has been noted to be elevated in patients with PAP in previous studies.
 We sought to extend this observation in a series of patients with PAP by looking at total serum LDH concentrations and LDH isoenzyme fractions measured before and after whole lung lavage.
 Total LDH and LDH isoenzymes were also determined in the lavage effluent.
 Total serum LDH was elevated before lavage in 10 of 16 patients.
 Prelavage serum LDH and prelavage alveolar-arterial O2 gradient showed a significant correlation (r = 0.62, p less than 0.05).
 A decrease in serum LDH was found after lavage in all patients in whom postlavage data was available (paired t test, p less than 0.01, n = 11), although the magnitude of this decrease varied considerably.
 The isoenzyme pattern before lavage was isomorphic, and this pattern was unchanged after whole lung lavage.
 This was in marked contrast to the LDH isoenzyme pattern observed in the lavage effluent, which showed a lower percent LDH1 and LDH2 and a higher percent LDH3, LDH4, and LDH5 when compared with the corresponding prelavage isoenzyme percentages for serum (unpaired t test, p less than 0.001).
 There was no correlation between the total serum LDH concentration and the total lavage LDH concentration.
 These data confirm that elevated serum LDH is a common finding in PAP.
 Furthermore, the LDH elevation found consistently in the alveolar fluid points to this as the source of the serum LDH.

"Reduction of neonatal mortality after multiple doses of bovine surfactant in low birth weight neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
 To determine if outcomes of low birth weight neonates with respiratory distress syndrome can be improved by the administration of multiple doses of bovine surfactant, we conducted two identical multicenter, controlled trials, and the results were combined for analysis.
 Seven hundred and ninety-eight neonates weighing 600 to 1750 g at birth who had developed respiratory distress syndrome within 6 hours of birth were assigned randomly to receive either 100 mg of phospholipid/kg of Survanta, a modified bovine surfactant (n = 402), or a sham dosing procedure (n = 396).
 Neonates whose respiratory distress persisted could be given up to three more doses, with all doses to be given in the first 48 hours after birth.
 Dosing was performed by investigators not involved in the clinical care of the neonates; nursery staff were kept blinded as to the treatment assignment.
 Fewer Survanta-treated neonates died of any cause (18.4% vs 27.3%, P = .002), died of respiratory distress syndrome (9.0% vs 20.3%, P less than .001), and either died or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to respiratory distress syndrome (51.2% vs 64.6%, P less than .001).
 Neonates who received Survanta also had greater improvement in their oxygenation and ventilatory status from baseline to 72 hours than did control neonates.
 Survanta-treated neonates were at lowered risk for developing pulmonary interstitial emphysema (18.6% vs 39.3%, P less than .001) and other pulmonary air leaks (11.5% vs 25.9%, P less than .001).

"Hypercarbic periodic breathing during sleep in a child with a central nervous system tumor.
 A 4-yr-old girl with a ganglioglioma involving the cerebellum and pons presented with CO2 retention and arterial O2 desaturation during wakefulness and sleep.
 Despite the presence of a regular respiratory pattern during wakefulness, NREM sleep was associated with the appearance of a sustained periodic respiratory pattern characterized by clusters of usually two breaths separated by an 8 to 10-s expiratory pause.
 At sleep onset, this Biot's respiratory pattern appeared immediately after a sigh.
 Breathing frequency during NREM sleep became regular with administration of supplemental O2 and an attendant increase in end-tidal CO2.
 Shortly after withdrawal of supplemental O2 during NREM sleep, the periodic pattern resumed and was again immediately preceded by a sigh.
 The observations during NREM sleep in this patient with a central nervous system abnormality indicate that Biot's type respiratory pattern may be reversed by administration of supplemental oxygen.
 The results in this patient suggest: (1) the presence of a very elevated CO2 apnea threshold, and (2) that the pons may play a role in determining the effect of hypercapnic hypoxia on respiratory pattern during sleep.

"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with Pneumocystis carinii. Ultrastructural identification in bronchoalveolar lavage in AIDS and immunocompromised non-AIDS patients.
 Pneumocystis carinii (PC) has been recognized as frequently responsible for most opportunistic pulmonary infections occurring in immunocompromised AIDS and non-AIDS patients.
 Moreover, these patients can be considered at risk for secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
 Therefore, we have investigated the occurrence of associated secondary alveolar proteinosis and PC pneumonitis in AIDS and non-AIDS immunocompromised patients.
 In a series of 26 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) in patients with PC pneumonitis (19 AIDS and seven non-AIDS patients), we observed on light microscopy, in addition to the honeycombed material, areas of an extracellular material that had a different pattern which was suggestive of that described in alveolar proteinosis.
 A systematic ultrastructural study of these 26 BAL fluid samples demonstrated in each of them an accumulation of phospholipid surfactantlike extracellular material mixed or not with the PC cysts.
 In nine cases, the observation of lipoproteinaceous material on light microscopy and abundant phospholipid material with myelinlike and myelin tubular laminated structures on electron microscopy was highly suggestive of an associated pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).
 Such an accumulation of extracellular material was not observed in the 11 BAL fluid samples collected in immunocompromised patients (seven AIDS and four non-AIDS patients) without PC pneumonitis.
 These findings demonstrated a particular frequency of associated PAP with PC pneumonitis.
 These results raise important questions concerning (1) the consequence of such an alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material on the clinical status and prognosis of the pneumonitis, and (2) the mechanisms responsible for this accumulation.

"Response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous oxygen/carbon dioxide monitoring system.
 We tested the response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous (tc) PO2/PCO2 monitoring system in healthy subjects who breathed various gas mixtures, and we compared steady-state tc readings to simultaneous arterial blood gas analysis in 20 stable respiratory outpatients.
 The electrodes were simple to apply, required very little skin preparation, and had trivial signal drift.
 In healthy subjects, tcPCO2 lag time during CO2 rebreathing was 16.8 seconds, with a 90 percent response time of 77.9 seconds after CO2 breathing was discontinued.
 The 90 percent response times of the O2 electrode when subjects breathed a hypoxic mixture was 257 seconds after a lag of 31 seconds.
 When inhaled gas mixtures were changed from hypoxia to room air, the lag time was shorter (12.5 seconds), but 90 percent response time exceeded 5 minutes.
 In stable patients with respiratory disease, tcPCO2 and tcPO2 were linearly related to PaCO2 (range, 19 to 53 mm Hg) and PaO2 (range, 45 to 99 mm Hg), respectively (tcPCO2 = 1.4 PaCO2-9.44, with r = 0.90 and SEE = 5.35 mm Hg; tcPO2 = 0.56 PaO2 + 20.4, with r = 0.53 and SEE = 11.7 mm Hg).
 We conclude that the response of the dual transcutaneous monitoring system is more rapid for the CO2 than the O2 electrode and may be rapid enough to be useful in some clinical settings; however, the O2 system fails to offer the response characteristics and accuracy that would allow it to be substituted for arterial gas tensions in unstable clinical situations.

 Categorization was based on STC without knowledge of clinical status: group 1 (25) had STC less than 2.5 mg/L; group 2 (25), STC greater than or equal to 2.5 less than 10 (6.2 +/- 0.4) mg/L; group 3 (25), STC greater than or equal to 10 less than or equal to 20 (15.8 +/- 0.4) mg/L; and group 4 (25), STC greater than 20 (27.8 +/- 1.1) mg/L.
 SETTING: A university-affiliated teaching hospital.
 RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients were receiving theophylline in an oral form, with a similar distribution found in all groups.
 Groups were not different with respect to age, clinical diagnoses, electrocardiographic patterns, arterial pH or gases, serum calcium, or treatment with beta-agonists.
 Although fewer patients in group 1 were receiving steroids than those in the other groups, and serum potassium was lower in group 3 than in group 1 (4.0 +/- 0.6 vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mEq/L, p less than 0.05), on multivariate analysis, serum potassium was not an independent predictor of arrhythmia, and treatment with steroids or digoxin was, at most, only weakly associated with the presence of arrhythmia.
 Heart rate was directly related to STC (r = 0.64, p less than 0.01), and STC was the strongest independent predictor of arrhythmia in this population.
 Although only 20 percent of patients in group 1 or 2 had arrhythmias, 48 percent of group 3 (p less than 0.05) and 56 percent of group 4 (p less than 0.05) had this finding.
 Moreover, the odds ratio of group 3 having an arrhythmia compared with group 1 was 3.7, 1.5 to 11.7, p less than 0.01.
 Multifocal atrial tachycardia was found in 8 percent of the patients in group 3 and 16 percent in group 4 but in none of the patients in groups 1 or 2.
 Two patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia died suddenly within 24 hours of having their STC measurement; none had concomitant ventricular ectopy.
 CONCLUSION: Theophylline causes tachycardia and serious arrhythmias even at STC considered to be therapeutic.
 Multifocal atrial tachycardia, an arrhythmia associated with use of this drug, may herald sudden cardiac death.

"Changes of lung surfactant and pressure-volume curve in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
 We investigated whether alveolar surface force increased and participated in the lung pressure-volume relationship in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in hamsters and, if so, whether lung surfactant was hampered in the lungs.
 On the air-filled pressure-volume curve, decreases of lung volume from control level were significantly higher at 3-8 cmH2O pressure on day 10 than on day 30.
 Because the change of lung tissue elasticity evaluated from the saline-filled pressure-volume curve was equal for the 2 days, the higher decrease of air volume on day 10 was due primarily to contribution of alveolar surface force.
 Pressure differences between deflation limbs of air-filled and saline-filled pressure-volume curves, which represented net alveolar surface force, were significantly higher at any lung volume between 50 and 90% total lung capacity on day 10, but almost no significance was observed on day 30.
 Phospholipid concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid significantly decreased on day 10 but had improved by day 30.
 Analysis of phospholipid species in purified lung surfactant showed decreased fractions of disaturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol on day 10.
 Surface-active properties of the surfactant, measured by a modified Wilhelmy balance, were remarkably hampered on day 10, but most of them had improved by day 30.
 We consider that the quantitative and functional abnormalities of lung surfactant have a part in the aggravation of lung mechanics in the acute phase of pulmonary fibrosis.

"A phase I study of chronic daily dosing of oral etoposide in combination with cisplatin for patients with advanced cancer.
 A dose escalation study of daily oral etoposide and cisplatin was carried out on 22 patients with advanced cancer using starting doses of 20 mg/m2/d of etoposide given orally for 21 days and 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin given intravenously (IV) on day 1.
 A total of 40 courses were given.
 Myelosuppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity, with a maximum tolerated dose of 50 mg/m2/d of oral etoposide for 21 days plus 80 mg/m2 of IV cisplatin on day 1.
 Doses of 40 mg/m2/d of etoposide for 21 days plus 80 mg/m2 of cisplatin for 1 day in four of eight courses (50%) were associated with Grade 3 or worse leukopenia that occurred between days 18 and 26.
 However, no Grade 3 or worse thrombocytopenia occurred at this dose level.
 Nausea and vomiting occurred in most patients at each dose level but were mild and could be controlled by antiemetics.
 Alopecia also occurred frequently.
 Significant mucositis (Grade 4) occurred in one patient, but no other toxicities were observed.
 Four partial responses that lasted from 1.3 to 5.8+ months were observed in patients with cervical (one patient), small cell lung (one patient), and squamous cell lung cancer (two patients); one of them had been heavily pretreated with platin analogue-containing regimens.
 The recommended doses for Phase II studies on this schedule are 40 mg/m2/d of oral etoposide for 21 days plus 80 mg/m2 of IV cisplatin on day 1.
 A combination regimen on this schedule seems particularly effective in patients with etoposide-sensitive malignancies.

"Thoracoscopic treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax using carbon dioxide laser.
 In an effort to improve the success rate of the previously described thoracoscopic electrocautery ablation technique of spontaneous pneumothorax, the carbon dioxide laser was evaluated in 12 patients.
 The recurrent (5 patients) or persistent (7 patients) spontaneous pneumothoraces were caused by rupture of (1) blebs in 6 patients, (2) intrapulmonary apical type II bullae in 3 patients, and (3) diffuse bullous emphysema, type III, in 3.
 The air leaks were successfully sealed in all but 1 patient with ruptured type II bulla.
 Surgical specimen from this single failure suggested that the entire inner lining of the bullae must be thermocoagulated.
 This technical modification led to successful outcome in 2 subsequent cases.
 With the use of carbon dioxide laser, it was possible to treat not only small blebs but all types of bullae causing spontaneous pneumothorax.
 Laser thoracoscopy is effective and safe in treating spontaneous pneumothorax.

"Causes of death in the elderly and their changing pattern in Hisayama, a Japanese community. Results from a long-term and autopsy-based study.
 The causes of death for the elderly were prospectively studied in Hisayama, Japan, a rural community.
 We compared 1,621 subjects, aged 40 years or over, recruited in 1961, and 2,053 subjects recruited in 1974.
 Each cohort was studied in a follow-up that lasted 10 years; they had autopsy rates of 82.1% and 86.1% during each 10-year period, respectively.
 The most common causes of death for those aged 70 years or over were cerebrovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and pneumonia.
 Deaths due to cerebrovascular disease tended to decrease in the recent cohort, but the proportion of decline was more prominent in cases aged 40 to 69 years.
 There was a sex difference in the changing pattern of mortality from heart diseases including ischemic heart disease.
 Deaths by both heart diseases and ischemic heart disease increased in the more recent cohort of aged women, whereas they decreased in the aged men.
 Pneumonia was an important cause of death for the elderly in both cohorts.
 Deaths due to ""senility"" were rare, being only 1% of the deceased aged 70 or over.
 With prolonged lifespan, especially for women, the impact of atherosclerosis and its related disorders on the recent Japanese aged population appears to have increased.

"Increased susceptibility to lung dysfunction in female smokers.
 The interaction between sex and smoking habits on pulmonary function was examined among 1,149 adults 25 to 59 yr of age in a rural community in Saskatchewan.
 Pulmonary function tests included FVC, FEV1, maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMFR), the slope of phase III of the single-breath nitrogen test (delta N2/L), and closing volume as a percent of vital capacity (CV/VC).
 The data show that after fixing the effects of age, height, and weight by analysis of covariance, the adjusted means of delta N2/L in nonsmokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers were 0.92, 1.10, and 1.60% in women and 0.97, 1.05, and 1.23% in men, respectively.
 The difference in the adjusted means for delta N2/L between smokers and nonsmokers was larger in women than in men, 0.67% versus 0.26%, respectively.
 Multiple multivariate analyses show that the regression slopes for the residuals of FEV1, MMFR, and delta N2/L versus pack-years were significantly different between men and women.
 The regressions of FEV1 and MMFR decreased and the regression of delta N2/L increased with increasing pack-years more rapidly in women than in men.
 The combined effect of sex and pack-years on pulmonary function was not significant for ex-smokers.
 These data suggest that cigarette smoking may be more detrimental in its effects on lung function in women than in men.

"Global T wave inversion.
 Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly.
 There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs.
 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions.
 There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs.
 -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034).
 The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36).
 Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization.
 Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion.
 Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries.

"Prospective study of nosocomial pneumonia and of patient and circuit colonization during mechanical ventilation with circuit changes every 48 hours versus no change.
 Circuits on mechanical ventilators with cascade humidifiers are routinely changed every day or every other day, although humidifying cascades have been considered unlikely to increase the risk of respiratory infection because they do not generate aerosols.
 Moreover, changing ventilator tubings every 24 rather than every 48 h increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
 To study the effects of ventilator circuit changes on the rate of nosocomial pneumonia and on patient and circuit colonization, 73 consecutive patients requiring continuous mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h were randomly assigned to either ventilator circuit changes every 48 h (Group 1, n = 38) or no change (Group 2, n = 35).
 Patients dying or being weaned before 96 h were not analyzed (Group 1 n = 3; Group 2 n = 7; leaving Group 1 n = 35 and Group 2 n = 28; p = 0.13).
 Ventilator-associated pneumonia was defined as the occurrence during mechanical ventilation or within 48 h after weaning of a new and persistent infiltrate on chest X-ray, purulent tracheal secretions, and a positive culture of a protected brush specimen (greater than or equal to 10(3) cfu/ml).
 Bacterial colonization was assessed every 48 h by quantitative cultures of pharyngeal swab, tracheal aspirate, humidifying cascade, and expiratory tubing trap.
 The two groups were similar in terms of age, indication for and duration of ventilation, and severity of illness.

"Comparative study of Legionella pneumophila and other nosocomial-acquired pneumonias.
 We studied, in a prospective way, the characteristics of definitively diagnosed nosocomially acquired pneumonias in our hospital over 36 months.
 Out of 55 cases, 27 were due to Legionella pneumophila and 28 to other, non-Legionella bacteria.
 The cases of legionellosis concentrated in July, August, and December.
 The only risk factors that showed significant differences (p less than 0.05) were general anesthesia and surgery and immunosuppressive disease, which were more frequent in the non-Legionella group, as were chronic liver disease and lowering of consciousness level.
 The absence of severe underlying disease, chronic or not, was uncommon in both groups, but more frequent in the Legionella group.
 We observed no differences in the clinical features of the two groups.
 Mean values of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and total bilirubin were higher (p less than 0.05) in the non-Legionella group.
 The only x-ray data that showed significant difference were pleural effusion, more frequent in the non-Legionella group (p less than 0.02).
 The mortality rate of legionellosis was 14.6 percent compared to 35.7 percent for the non-Legionella group (p less than 0.05).
 We conclude that a sure differential diagnosis based on clinical, roentgenographic and analytical features of both groups is not possible.
 The relatively low mortality rate of the Legionella group, when compared to other series of nosocomial legionellosis, could be due to the standard use of erythromycin in the therapeutic approach to nosocomial-acquired pneumonia in our hospital.

"Clinicopathologic studies of children who die of acute lower respiratory tract infections: mechanisms of death.
 Clinicopathologic correlations for 71 cases of fatal pneumonia in children were determined.
 The mechanism of death for these patients was multifactorial.
 Severe pneumonia alone accounted for 11 deaths (15.5%).
 Pneumonia associated with sepsis occurred in 42 children (59.2%).
 Heart failure (8.5%), hypovolemia (4.2%), and nosocomial infection (12.6%) were also seen in children with fatal acute lower respiratory tract infection.
 Extensive consolidation, squamous metaplasia, and hyaline membranes were present in the lungs of these children.
 Patients with severe disease must receive, in addition to antibiotics for acute episodes, individualized intensive respiratory and supportive care.
 Since these types of care are not available in poor communities, vaccination against measles and vitamin A supplementation for malnourished children may ameliorate the conditions that appear to predispose these children to severe or fatal disease.

 Emergency pulmonary resection was performed because of complicated pneumonia in eight patients (5 pneumonectomies, 2 lobectomies, 1 bilobectomy) over a 2-year period.
 The patients' age range was 5 months to 43 years.
 The indications were rapid aggravation of respiratory insufficiency in children with staphylococcal pneumonia and enlarging pneumatoceles, and massive hemoptysis in patients with chronic destructive pneumonia.
 Two patients died after pneumonectomy, one from contralateral aspiration and one from cardiogenic shock.
 Postoperative complications occurred in four cases--bronchopleural fistula and pyopneumothorax in three and thoracic empyema with massive chest-wall infection in one.
 Only two patients had an uneventful postoperative course.

"Is a chest radiograph necessary in the evaluation of every febrile infant less than 8 weeks of age?
 This study was designed to examine the relationship between respiratory signs and the likelihood of having an abnormal chest radiograph in a sample of febrile infants less than 8 weeks of age.
 The sample consisted of 242 infants who were admitted during a 3-year period with temperatures greater than or equal to 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) and had a chest radiograph.
 The house officer recorded the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms including rhinorrhea, tachypnea, cough, rales, wheezes, retractions, and rhonchi.
 Each chest radiograph was reviewed independently according to predetermined criteria by a senior radiology resident and an attending pediatric radiologist.
 Interobserver agreement was 91%.
 Both observers were blind to the infants' respiratory signs.
 The chest radiograph interpretations were compared with the presence of respiratory signs.
 Of the 242 cases, 228 had chest radiographs available for interpretation.
 Of these, 27 chest radiographs (12%) were identified as abnormal, including 6 where there was initial disagreement as to the presence of an abnormality.
 Twenty-five (31%) of 80 infants with any respiratory signs had an abnormal chest radiograph, whereas only 2 (1%) of 148 asymptomatic infants did.
 The sensitivity of respiratory signs was 93% (confidence interval = 76% to 99%).
 These findings suggest that in the absence of respiratory signs, febrile infants are unlikely to have an abnormal chest radiograph.

"Continuous lateral rotational therapy and nosocomial pneumonia.
 The adverse effects of prolonged immobility are due primarily to gravitational effects on blood flow and ventilation, impairment of the normal mucociliary escalator and possibly an increase in extravascular lung water.
 However, CLRT theoretically should reverse these abnormalities.
 The sequence of events that culminate in LRTI or pneumonia is unclear; however, low tidal volumes, increased extravascular lung water and the accumulation of bronchopulmonary secretions may lead to atelectasis, a well-known precursor of pneumonia.
 Three prospective, randomized studies evaluating patients with acute head trauma, orthopedic injuries requiring traction and blunt chest trauma all showed a decreased incidence of LRTI or pneumonia with CLRT compared with those treated in a conventional bed and turned every 2 h by the nursing staff.
 In general, the methodology was sound with early randomization, use of precise criteria to define LRTI and pneumonia and appropriate observation.
 The fourth study performed in a medical ICU with a heterogeneous group of patients did not show a difference in incidence of nosocomial pneumonia between treatment in CLRT and a conventional bed, but did show a decreased length of ICU stay for patients with pneumonia treated with CLRT.
 It appears that if CLRT is to be effective, it needs to be instituted early in the patient's illness.
 The length of time that CLRT should be utilized is unknown; however, intuitively, as long as the patient is at risk, the therapy should be continued.
 It is also unclear whether CLRT should be started at full rotation immediately or begun at lesser degrees of rotation and advanced serially over several hours.
 Another unknown is the minimum time that CLRT should be administered per day.
 In the studies discussed, most patients were rotated for 10 to 16 h/day.
 The minimum degree of rotation necessary for an effect is also unknown; in the studies cited, rotations from 40 degrees to 62 degrees in each direction were used.
 Based on the current data, the early use of CLRT in comatose or otherwise immobile patients decreases the incidence of LRTI including pneumonia over the first 7 to 14 days of ICU care.
 The prevention of pneumonia and more rapid transfer from the ICU should offset the additional expense of a specialized bed.
 The data suggest that a multicenter study with accrual of a large number of patients to evaluate this form of therapy in a prospective, randomized study is necessary.
 If the hypothesis that CLRT decreases the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU is proven, the impact on critical care in the 90s would be substantial.

"Evaluation of the hemodynamic and respiratory effects of inverse ratio ventilation with a right ventricular ejection fraction catheter.
 Pc-IRV has been shown to have respiratory advantages, compared with CPPV.
 However, the hemodynamic effects of this ventilation mode have not yet been fully elucidated.
 We used a REF catheter to monitor the hemodynamic changes in the RV.
 Fifteen ARDS patients were included in the study.
 The respiratory data showed a 35 percent decrease of PIP and a 32 percent decrease of VTi and VTe with Pc-IRV 4:1 compared with CPPV.
 Hemodynamic parameters showed a significant incrase in CI (17 percent) in Pc-IRV 4:1, without change in REF.
 Observing in retrospect the pressure-volume relationship of the RV, we could differentiate a preload (group 1) and an afterload dependent group of patients (group 2), CI was significantly different in the two groups as it rose only in the preload-dependent patients.
 RVEDVI showed a significant change in group 1, whereas this was absent in the second group.
 REF was maintained in switching ventilation from CPPV to Pc-IRV with increasing I:E ratio.
 Pc-IRV appears to be a good alternative ventilatory mode in comparison with CPPV in a selected group of patients with preload dependency (responders); in these patients with respiratory insufficiency, close hemodynamic monitoring is required to optimize ventilation, especially in relation to the hemodynamic effects.

"Cellular and molecular basis of the asbestos-related diseases.
 Asbestosis is an inflammatory and fibrotic process of the alveolar structures mediated, at least in part, by cytokines released by ""activated"" alveolar macrophages.
 The process of phagocytosis and ""activation"" of alveolar macrophages is poorly understood.
 Are all macrophages activated or only subpopulations? Which cytokines are up-regulated? How does the local milieu modulate profibrotic and antifibrotic mediators? Is protein release accompanied by up-regulation of gene transcription? Is there an ordered sequence of cytokine activity? What roles do neutrophils and lymphocytes play? How can disease progression best be quantified absent further exposure? Answers to these questions are important to direct rational strategies at interdicting the fibrotic process.
 The question of cancer and asbestos is more vexing.
 The processes of inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis appear to be closely intertwined.
 For example, proto-oncogenes such as c-sis (PDGF B-chain) are up-regulated in activated alveolar macrophages from fibrotic lungs; these and possibly others may play an important role in asbestos carcinogenesis.
 Second, asbestos can transfect DNA into cells.
 Furthermore, DNA can adhere to asbestos fibers, and these fibers are capable of direct transmigration into cells.
 The questions of the mechanisms of cigarette smoke cocarcinogenicity and latency remain.
 Lastly, if the bronchial epithelium is highly metaplastic throughout from cigarette smoking, what triggers a single (or several) nidus of cells to transform into carcinoma? Malignant mesothelioma poses the most challenging questions because of association with brief asbestos exposure by history.
 Mesothelial cells are susceptible to minute environmental manipulations, and changes occur after exposure to all fiber types.
 Yet epidemiologic studies point toward long amphiboles as having greater mesothelioma risk.
 To test this hypothesis, experimental data must be generated differentiating tumorigenesis risk from short, chrysotile fibers that can migrate to the parietal pleura from the associations of long amphiboles persisting in lung tissue.
 Despite the future decreasing numbers of clinical cases of asbestos-related disease, solving the important mechanistic questions remaining will contribute significantly to our understanding of fibrosis and cancer.

 Seventy-two patients were randomized into a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effects of epidural (EA) versus general anesthesia (GA) on the incidence of thromboembolic disease (TED) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
 Males received aspirin 650 mg po bid and females low-dose warfarin daily to maintain the prothrombin time at 15 to 16 seconds for pharmacologic prophylaxis against TED.
 Thirty-four patients had EA and 38 GA for their primary TKA.
 Contrast venography and ventilation-perfusion scanning were performed on the sixth, seventh, and eighth postoperative days, and these were interpreted in a blinded fashion.
 The mean age of the 45 males and 27 females was 64 years (range, 42-84 years).
 There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to hematocrit, operative time, blood loss, number of units transfused, or hospital stay.
 Twelve of the 34 patients (35%) receiving an EA and 10 of the 38 patients (26%) receiving GA developed TED, an overall incidence of 31% (p greater than 0.05) Fifty-three percent of the clots were located in the popliteal vein above the trifurcation or more proximal.
 However, the incidence of proximal vein thrombosis was significantly less in patients receiving an EA (46%) rather than a GA (64%).
 The incidence and distribution of clots was not affected by the type of pharmacologic prophylaxis, gender, or use of methylmethacrylate.
 Ten percent of the patients had a positive scan by strict criteria and were thought to have a pulmonary embolism (PE).
 In patients with a femoral vein clot, the incidence of PE was 67%.
 One bleeding complication occurred in a patient who took double the appropriate warfarin dose.

"Use of intrapleural streptokinase in the treatment of thoracic empyema.
 The incidence of pleural effusions in bacterial pneumonia may exceed 40%, a factor that may be related to increased morbidity and mortality.
 Options in the treatment of complicated pleural effusions or empyema, when unresponsive to closed tube drainage, include repositioning of the indwelling tube thoracostomy or insertion of additional chest tubes, instillation of intrapleural streptokinase, and surgical intervention.
 The authors describe the course of three patients wherein the use of intrapleural streptokinase was efficacious in effecting prompt drainage of previously inadequately evacuated empyema, thus eliminating the necessity for further invasive intervention.

"Angioedema from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: a cause of upper airway obstruction.
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have several side effects of concern to the otolaryngologist.
 Angioedema is a rare, but potentially lethal adverse effect when associated with upper airway obstruction.
 Four cases of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, three with significant upper airway obstruction, are reported.
 Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibition appears to be mechanism based.
 The probable link is the potentiation of bradykinin, which results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and angioedema.
 Since angioedema can progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association.
 The differential diagnosis and treatment of this adverse effect is discussed, as well as a review of ACE inhibitors and other causes of angioedema.

"Expiratory computed tomography for assessment of suspected pulmonary emphysema.
 Results of computed tomography of the lung performed at two levels in upper lung zones at full inspiration and full expiration were compared with results of tests of ventilatory function, lung mechanics, and single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity in 64 subjects, many of whom had some form of airflow obstruction.
 From the CT scans, the mean percentage of pixels in the range -900 to -1,024 Hounsfield units, or pixel index, was determined for each subject.
 The highest correlations of pixel index with physiologic variables consistent with a diagnosis of emphysema were observed for CT taken at full expiration.
 In some subjects, the inspiratory CT would give a ""false positive"" for emphysema when the hyperaeration observed at inspiration was not observed at expiration.
 We believe that the CT scan taken at full expiration can effectively reveal the abnormal permanent enlargement of airspaces which defines emphysema and provides a noninvasive method of assessing lung morphology in the living human subject.

"Distribution patterns of type VII collagen in normal and malignant human tissues.
 The distribution of basement membrane type VII collagen was detected immunohistochemically and compared in normal human organs and their neoplastic derivatives using monoclonal antibody LH7.2.
 In normal tissues, type VII collagen was found to be restricted to the basement membrane surrounding or underlying combined epithelia, such as those lining breast, prostate, and bronchus, which are composed of a basal and luminal cell layer, and stratified epithelia, such as larynx, esophagus, trachea, vagina, ectocervix, and epidermis.
 No type VII collagen was found in the ""simple' epithelia lining the major part of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, such as liver, stomach, and intestine, or around blood vessels, muscle, and nerve fibers, which are surrounded, however, by a basement membrane containing type IV collagen and laminin.
 When tested in benign and malignant local tumors, antibody LH7.2 showed staining patterns partly similar to those observed in the corresponding normal tissues.
 This resulted in a well-circumscribed positive reaction around ducts in carcinomas in situ of the breast, in benign prostate tumors, in pleomorphic adenomas, and in a negative reaction in tumors of the GI tract.
 Furthermore type VII collagen was predominantly seen in carcinomas with a squamous differentiation, such as squamous carcinomas of the lung, head and neck, vulva, and vagina.
 These results indicate that the presence of type VII collagen in malignant tumors is correlated with (squamous) differentiation rather than with the origin of the tumor.
 With tumor progression, an increased presence of type VII collagen, as compared with normal urinary bladder, was found in infiltrating transitional cell carcinomas.
 Thus, although in general invasive and metastatic tumors do not express extensively type VII collagen, exceptions to this rule exist in bladder cancer, squamous carcinomas of the lung, tumors of the head and neck region, female genital tract tumors, and in some adenocarcinomas of the breast.

"A double-blind comparison of intranasal budesonide with placebo for nasal polyposis.
 Intranasal budesonide, 400 micrograms two times a day, was evaluated in 36 patients referred for treatment of nasal polyposis.
 The age range was 20 to 68 years.
 Polypectomy was done 5.6 (mean) times previously.
 After a 5-week, treatment-free, baseline period, patients were treated in a double-blind fashion with either budesonide or placebo during 4 weeks.
 After this treatment period, placebo-treated patients started receiving budesonide in an open trial for an additional 4 weeks.
 The patients rated their nasal symptoms daily.
 Nasal examinations and nasal inspiratory flow rate (IFR) measurements were done at clinic visits.
 After 3 and 4 weeks of treatment, the response to budesonide was significantly greater than response to placebo.
 The greater reduction in nasal blockage caused by polyps, observed on physical examination, p = 0.005, was mirrored by an increase in nasal IFR (p = 0.0001).
 Patient rating of the severity and frequency of nasal blockage were reduced more by budesonide than by placebo (p less than or equal to 0.0005).
 Switching placebo-treated patients to budesonide treatment resulted in a reduction of nasal blockage (p less than 0.001) and an increase in nasal IFR (p less than 0.001).
 The results demonstrate that topical nasal budesonide, 400 micrograms two times a day, is an effective treatment of nasal polyps.

"Necrotizing tracheitis caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum: unique case and review.
 The occasional pathogenicity of nondiphtheria corynebacteria in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals is now well established.
 Previously described sites of infection include heart valves, wounds, urinary tract, and lungs.
 This report of necrotizing tracheitis caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum illustrates the widening spectrum of infections caused by these organisms.
 A 54-year-old man developed respiratory distress and symptoms of upper airway obstruction unresponsive to inhaled bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, or intravenous erythromycin.
 A spirometry flow-volume loop demonstrated fixed upper airway obstruction.
 Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed a circumferential inflammatory process partially occluding the tracheal lumen.
 Gram staining revealed gram-positive rods typical of corynebacteria, and cultures of tracheal tissue yielded C.

 There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for exotoxin or cell-associated toxins.
 Treatment with intravenous penicillin resulted in resolution of the inflammatory process and eradication of the organisms, as assessed by subsequent cultures.

"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and cough. Prevalence in an outpatient medical clinic population.
 To determine the frequency of ACE inhibitor cough in an outpatient medical clinic population, a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey using mailed questionnaires was done.
 Patients were randomly selected from a computerized hospital pharmacy data base.
 The overall prevalence of cough was 19 percent in the ACE inhibitor groups compared with 9 percent in the hydrochlorothiazide-treated group.
 The observed odds ratio for cough among ACE inhibitor users was 2.3 (95 percent CI, 1.02 to 5.00).
 This study is the first systematic investigation of frequency and characteristics of ACE inhibitor cough that includes a control group.
 Our results suggest that cough may more frequently accompany treatment with ACE inhibitors than has been previously reported.
 We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about cough in patients taking an ACE inhibitor.
 Recognition of this side effect may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of patients receiving ACE inhibitors.

"Late asthmatic responses after exercise challenge are reproducible.
 In this study the reproducibility of a late asthmatic reaction (LAR) after exercise challenge (EC) has been documented.
 Eighty-three hospitalized patients with asthma were challenged with exercise.
 The patients were examined according to a standardized protocol that comprised 8 minutes of bicycling at 90% of predicted heart rate.
 An LAR after EC was considered to have occurred when there was a fall in peak expiratory flow rate greater than or equal to 20% on three or more time points on the exercise day compared to corresponding clock time on a control day.
 According to these criteria, 11 patients (13.3%) experienced an LAR.
 Those patients were rechallenged 21 to 150 days after the first EC, without changing the therapy regimen of the patients, to study its reproducibility.
 Eight patients (73%) demonstrated a reproducible LAR after EC based on the criteria for a positive LAR.
 Although the LAR after EC was reproducible, the time points at which the LAR took place after the second EC differed from LARs after the first EC.
 Our results indicate that the LAR after EC occurs in a considerable number of patients with bronchial asthma and is quite reproducible.

"Effects of air pollution resulting from wire reclamation incineration on pulmonary function in children.
 This study evaluated the effect of long-term air pollution resulting from wire reclamation incineration on pulmonary function in children.
 General physical examination and the determination of spirometric parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%) were conducted in 400 primary school children between ages 9 and 11 years who reside in one control and three polluted areas.
 A survey using ATS-DLD-78-C questionnaire indicated that there were no significant differences in their demographic characteristics among children in the four areas under study.
 Those who had nonrespiratory diseases that might affect pulmonary function and those who failed to perform spirometric measurements were excluded from the study; therefore, 382 children were included in data analysis.
 The results revealed that (1) the mean values of FVC and FEV1 (expressed as percentage of predicted values calculated from Polgar's equations) in the polluted areas were significantly lower than the nonpolluted area (p less than 0.05), and (2) the incidence of pulmonary function abnormality in the polluted areas was greater than that of the nonpolluted area (p less than 0.05).
 The results indicated that air pollution produced by wire reclamation incineration can impair children's pulmonary function.

"Lung cancer histology in Jews and Arabs in Israel, 1962-1982.
 Lung cancer rates in Israel are lower than in Western countries, not explainable by smoking habits.
 Because of the different relations of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma to smoking it was of interest to study the histologic distribution in Israel.
 A total of 7,871 histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were studied in the period 1962-1982.
 Squamous cell carcinoma was the leading tumor type in Jewish men and adenocarcinoma in Jewish women.
 Rates of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma increased throughout the period in both Jewish men and women, but the increase in adenocarcinoma was more pronounced in the last study period than that in squamous cell carcinoma.
 In 1977-1982 the rate ratio of squamous cell carcinoma to adenocarcinoma among Jewish men was 1.7.
 In Arab men it was 2.9, and in Jewish women 0.57.
 The Kreyberg I/II ratio among Jewish men was about 2.7 with no clear trend throughout the study period, and among Arab men this gradually decreased from 8.1 to 3.5.
 Jewish women had a constant Kreyberg I/II ratio of about 1 through the whole study period, but the ratio in Arab women was significantly higher than 1, with a mean overall ratio of 3.2.

"Attenuation of IL-2-induced multisystem organ edema by phalloidin and antamanide.
 Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with diverse effects, including the ability to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation into cells capable of lysing tumor.
 Its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of side effects such as breakdown of the microvascular barrier and edema.
 Control of the microvascular barrier is in part regulated by endothelial cell cytoskeletal contractile proteins.
 This study tests whether the cyclopeptides that maintain actin filament organization and distribution and reduce macromolecular flux across the endothelial cell junction in vitro would similarly maintain barrier tightness and prevent early edema produced by IL-2 in vivo.
 Anesthetized rats were treated at 30-min periods with intravenous saline (0.5 ml, n = 41), phalloidin (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), or antamanide, (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), starting 30 min before the 1-h infusion of 10(6) U of recombinant human IL-2 or saline.
 Six hours after the start of IL-2, there was edema in the saline/IL-2 group, as measured by increased wet-to-dry ratios (W/D) in the lungs, heart, and kidney.
 With saline/IL-2, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contained an elevated protein concentration and higher plasma thromboxane levels compared with controls.
 The number of neutrophils sequestered in the lungs was more than twice that of saline controls.
 Phalloidin significantly attenuated edema in lung and reduced BAL protein leak.
 Antamanide treatment was as effective in limiting lung and heart edema, but, in contrast to phalloidin, antamanide prevented kidney edema and did not lead to an alteration in the liver W/D.
 Antamanide also prevented BAL fluid protein leak.

"The role of antibiotic therapy in the prevention of empyema in patients with an isolated chest injury (ISS 9-10): a prospective study.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of an antibiotic regimen on the incidence of empyema in patients admitted with isolated chest trauma (ISS 9/10) and hemopneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy.
 All patients with isolated chest trauma and hemopneumothorax (estimated ISS 9 or 10) seen in our trauma center were considered eligible for this study.
 Patients were excluded for the following reasons: age less than 18 years, presence of shock at the time of initial resuscitation, ongoing antibiotic therapy for unrelated disease, documented pre-existing infection or documented abnormal immune status.
 Ninety patients were randomized to two treatment limbs: antibiotics and tube thoracostomy or tube thoracostomy alone.
 All patients had the procedure performed in the trauma center in a standard fashion.
 Wound care and tube care were identical.
 Antibiotic therapy consisted of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin), one dose given just before the procedure and then q 6 h into the tube removal.
 Injury Severity Scores were established as described by Schwab after the manner of Baker.
 Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test of binary outcome.
 In this study, antibiotics were able to reduce the incidence of empyema in patients with isolated chest trauma and for such patients antibiotic treatment appears justified.
 Further work is required to determine the effect on patients with more severe injury and multisystem involvement.

"Role of gastric colonization in the development of pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients: results of a prospective randomized trial.
 Critically ill trauma patients were entered in a prospective, randomized trial to determine the role of gastric colonization in the development of pneumonia.
 Trauma patients admitted to the SICU were randomized to receive antacids (n = 27), continuous IV cimetidine (n = 32), or sucralfate (n = 30).
 Quantitative nasogastric tube (NGT) cultures were obtained biweekly and correlated with gastric pH, the incidence of pneumonia, and the incidence of pneumonia caused by an organism previously isolated from the stomach (percentage of gastric source of pneumonia--% GSP).
 Patients receiving antacids had a significantly greater pH than those receiving cimetidine (5.6 +/- 1.03 vs.
 4.7 +/- 1.03; p = 0.006).
 However, there was no significant difference between the overall incidence of pneumonia, the percentage of NGT isolates greater than 10(6)/ml, or the % GSP.
 The gastric bacteriology of the three subgroups was nearly identical, with Candida albicans, Enterococci, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci being the most frequently isolated organisms.
 Gastric growth of organisms preceding their appearance in the blood occurred in 5 of 89 (5.6%) patients.
 These results suggest that 1) in trauma patients, the incidence of pneumonia is not increased by the use of stress ulcer prophylactic agents that elevate gastric pH; 2) increases in gastric pH progressively increased the number of intragastric bacteria but this did not correlate with an increased incidence of % GSP; and 3) while organisms in the upper intestinal tract may be pathogens for pneumonia, they are uncommonly a source of bacteremia in seriously injured patients.

"Prealbumin in the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours.
 The reliability of prealbumin as a diagnostic marker was studied in 60 cases of bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours.
 There were differences in the incidence of positivity between typical and atypical carcinoids (well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas).
 Seventy five per cent of the carcinoid tumours were positive for prealbumin; (86.7% typical and 63.3% atypical carcinoids).
 In 15 cases, which were Grimelius negative, 10 were prealbumin positive.
 Only 8.3% carcinoids were negative with both prealbumin and Grimelius stains.
 Ten squamous, 10 adeno- and 10 small cell carcinomas showed only occasional scattered prealbumin positive cells.
 It is concluded that prealbumin is a useful marker for bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumours.
 It is cheap, readily available, and should be considered part of routine diagnostic procedures for the diagnosis of carcinoid tumours.

 Forty-five homosexual male subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, who received care during a 4-month period in an ambulatory center for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), were classified according to their principal presentation with characteristic secondary infections (CDC group IV C, N = 28), cancers (IV D, N = 10), or limited or no symptoms (groups II, III, IV A, or IV B, N = 7).
 The incidence of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis increased after HIV seroconversion by approximately twofold in patients of groups IV C and IV D.
 The mean serum concentration of IgE was significantly higher for group IV C than for the other HIV-seropositive groups and for a control group of 45 HIV-seronegative homosexual male subjects from the same community who were studied concurrently.
 More patients in groups IV C and IV D had positive RASTs for a panel of environmental antigens than patients in the other HIV-seropositive groups and the HIV-seronegative control group.

 Ninety-one surgical procedures were performed.
 There were 63 (69 per cent) retroperitoneal lymph node dissections, 16 (18 per cent) thoracotomies, three (3 per cent) hepatic resections, three (3 per cent) craniotomies, five (5 per cent) delayed orchidectomies and one anterolateral decompression of the vertebral column.
 Nine (13 per cent) patients required a repeat retroperitoneal node dissection and one patient needed a repeat thoracotomy to remove recurrent metastatic deposits during the period of follow-up.
 Multivisceral resections and vascular reconstruction procedures were required in 20 (30 per cent) patients undergoing retroperitoneal node dissection.
 Fifty-five (82 per cent) patients remain in complete remission with a mean follow-up period of 49.6 months (range 2-121 months).
 Nine (13 per cent) patients died with metastatic disease between 2 months to 4 years after operation.

"Effect of sulfurous (thermal) water on T lymphocyte proliferative response.
 We studied the effect of sulfurous water thermal therapy on the phenotype and the proliferative response of peripheral lymphoid cells from ten subjects affected by chronic upper respiratory disease and from six suffering from articular and periarticular disorders.
 Sulfurous water (S-H2O) therapy did not modify the phenotype and function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) nor did it modify systemic immunologic reactivity.
 A different result was obtained by analyzing the response to mitogens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cell cultures containing graduated amounts of S-H2O.
 These ""in vitro"" studies have shown an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of S-H2O on mitogen induced T lymphocyte proliferation and on IL2 production.
 H2S present in S-H2O seems to be the primary component responsible for inhibition.

"Enhanced expression of CD2 antigen on lung T cells.
 CD2 molecules not only function in the adhesion of T cells to other cell types but also in the activation of T cells via an alternative pathway.
 To investigate the possible roles of CD2 molecules in the activation and accumulation of lung T cells, using monoclonal antibodies and a flow cytometer we evaluated CD2 antigen expression on lung and blood lymphocytes in 10 normal subjects, 30 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, 7 patients with interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease, 5 patients with farmer's lung disease, and 8 patients with Crohn's disease.
 The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD2 on lung T cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was significantly higher than that on blood T cells in all study groups except the control group.
 In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis this enhancement of the expression of CD2 antigen was observed only on CD4+ T cells.
 Since ligands for CD2 are present on immunocompetent cells of other types in the local pulmonary milieu, these results suggest that increased expression of CD2 molecules could facilitate the communication and interaction of lung T cells with their environment in the lung and thereby possibly contribute to the local accumulation of T cells.

"Improved survival after resection of pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma 
 The value of resecting pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma was retrospectively examined.
 Between 1981 and 1989, 56 patients (35 men and 21 women with a mean age of 49 years) had 65 pulmonary resections for histologically proven metastatic melanoma after treatment of the primary tumor.
 In patients undergoing thoracotomy, 50% (28/56) had pulmonary metastases as the initial site of recurrence.
 Twenty-eight patients (50%) had local-regional recurrence before the development of lung metastases.
 Eight lobectomies, two segmentectomies, and 55 wedge excisions were done.
 Fifty-four patients (54/56, 96%) underwent complete resection, and there were no operative deaths.
 The postthoracotomy actuarial survival was 25% at 5 years (median interval, 18 months).
 Location of the primary tumor, histology, thickness, Clark level, local-regional lymph node metastases, or type of resection was not associated with improved survival.
 Patients without regional nodal metastases before thoracotomy had a median survival of 30 months compared with 16 months for all others (p = 0.04).
 Patients with lung as the site of first recurrence had a median survival of 30 months compared with 17 months for patients with initial local-regional recurrence (p = 0.038, log-rank test).

"Long-term survival of patients with AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
 OBJECTIVE.--To evaluate the long-term survival of patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit, Cook County Hospital, Chicago, Ill, with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.
 DESIGN.--Cohort study over a 4-year period.
 SETTING.--Municipal teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS.--Seventy-three consecutive patients who had 75 episodes of P carinii pneumonia and acute respiratory failure were followed up from the time of hospital admission until their deaths or the termination of the study.
 OUTCOME MEASURES.--Duration of survival from the time of initial hospital admission with diagnoses of P carinii pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.
 RESULTS.--Consistent with recent reports of improved short-term outcome, the immediate hospital survival was 47% (35/75).
 The 1-year survival was 37% (95% confidence interval, 26% to 49%).
 Two patients have survived for 40 months.
 Almost three quarters of the patients who survived hospitalization lived for at least 1 year.
 CONCLUSIONS.--The long-term prognosis for patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, P carinii pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure is now substantially better than anticipated.
 Respiratory failure due to P carinii pneumonia does not necessarily signify the terminal phase of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Accordingly, patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, P carinii pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure can be appropriate candidates for life support in medical intensive care units.

 Twenty-eight patients were randomly allocated into a study group (A, n = 13) in which a nonabsorbable paste containing 2% tobramycin, 2% amphotericin B, and 2% polymyxin E was administered locally to decontaminate the oropharynx, and a control group (B, n = 15) in which a paste without antibiotics was also applied to the oropharynx.
 We studied the effectiveness of the prophylactic technique in decontaminating the oropharynx and trachea of organisms potentially pathogenic for the respiratory system.
 Decontamination was successful in ten of 13 patients in group A vs.
 one of 15 patients in group B (p less than .001).
 The results demonstrated a lower rate of infection in the lower respiratory tract in the study group (three patients with tracheobronchitis and no pneumonias) than in the control group (three patients with tracheobronchitis and 11 with pneumonia), the difference between both being highly significant (p less than .001).
 Two (15%) patients in group B developed sepsis of pulmonary origin.
 None of the patients on prophylactic treatment developed this complication.
 Although the overall mortality was similar in both groups (group A, 30% vs.
 group B, 33%), we believe that infection contributed to a great extent to the death of two of five patients in group B.
 We conclude that nosocomial pneumonia, which is a frequent complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, could be prevented by local application of nonabsorbable antibiotics to the oropharynx.

"Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in children of developing countries.
 Acute respiratory infections cause four and a half million deaths among children every year, the overwhelming majority occurring in developing countries.
 Pneumonia unassociated with measles causes 70% of these deaths; post-measles pneumonia, 15%; pertussis, 10%; and bronchiolitis and croup syndromes, 5%.
 Both bacterial and viral pathogens are responsible for these deaths.
 The most important bacterial agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus.
 The data on bacterial etiology of pneumonia during the first 3 months of life are limited, and almost no information on the role of chlamydia and pertussis in this age period is available.
 The distribution of viral pathogens in developing countries can be summarized as follows: respiratory syncytial virus, 15%-20%; parainfluenza viruses, 7%-10%; and influenza A and B viruses and adenovirus, 2%-4%.
 Mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently.
 Risk factors that increase the incidence and severity of lower respiratory infection in developing countries include large family size, lateness in the birth order, crowding, low birth weight, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, lack of breast feeding, pollution, and young age.
 Effective interventions for prevention and medical case management are urgently needed to save the lives of many children predisposed to severe disease.

"Occurrence, clinical manifestations, and prognosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
 In order to obtain more information on the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome and recent developments in its prognosis, we analysed the severity and prognosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome in children diagnosed and treated during the years 1980-6 throughout Finland.
 The criteria for Guillain-Barre syndrome were fulfilled in 14 boys and 13 girls.
 The mean annual number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome was thus 3.9, giving a mean annual incidence of 0.38/100,000 of population under 15 years of age (95% confidence intervals 0.25 to 0.56/100,000).
 The incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome causing permanent neurological defects in children under 15 years of age was 1.4/10 million annually (95% confidence intervals 0.035 to 7.8/10 million).
 Our figures appeared to be one fourth to a half of that reported earlier in children and even lower than those in adults.
 Although there were no deaths among our patients, mortality from Guillain-Barre syndrome seems to have remained similar for the last 20 years despite current awareness of the possibility of cardiac arrest and respiratory failure.

"Formaldehyde: an analysis of its respiratory, cutaneous, and immunologic effects.
 Formaldehyde is truly ubiquitous in our ecology and continuing important commercial applications.
 Most of us have daily contact with this chemical.
 The most significant outdoor source of this chemical is gasoline and diesel fuel combustion.
 The primary indoor source is combustion of tobacco products.
 Formaldehyde is associated with a disagreeable odor that can produce ""annoyance"" symptoms and at higher concentrations can be a transient and completely reversible irritant to the eyes and mucous membranes of the respiratory tract.
 It is so soluble and rapidly metabolized that it rarely reaches the lower respiratory tract to inflict damage.
 The exception is in cigarette smokers who actively inhale.
 Formaldehyde may on rare occasions induce bronchial asthma at relatively high exposure doses.
 There are no conclusive studies that prove the development of de novo IgE-mediated respiratory tract symptoms secondary to inhalation of formaldehyde vapors.
 The approach to formaldehyde-induced symptoms should be one of careful documentation of objective physiologic changes.

"The contributions of John B. Murphy to thoracic surgery.
 John B.
 Murphy was a prominent surgeon who lived in Chicago from the 1880s until his death in 1916.
 During his career, he was associated with both Rush Presbyterian and Northwestern Medical Schools.
 He was responsible for popularizing the use of an artificial pneumothorax as an effective adjunct in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.
 This modality was not, however, his original concept.
 In addition to all of the fields of general surgery, Murphy undertook the management of empyema and lesions of the chest wall and also performed thoracoplasty procedures.
 Although he had done several thoracotomy procedures in his laboratory, he rarely undertook this operation in a clinical setting.
 Drop ether anesthesia was used for all surgical procedures.
 Murphy did not use closed water seal drainage of the chest.
 His oration on thoracic surgery, given at the annual meeting of the AMA, in 1898, was an excellent monograph on the subject and undoubtedly contributed to the increased interest and progress in this field of surgery.
 Murphy was a wise surgeon, an able technician and a scholarly teacher.
 The high regard in which he was held by his contemporaries is best expressed by the remark of William Mayo, ""...he was the surgical genius of our generation"".

"Physiologic responses to intranasal dose-response challenges with histamine, methacholine, bradykinin, and prostaglandin in adult volunteers with and without nasal allergy.
 The dose-response (dose, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mg) profiles of 10 atopic and 10 nonatopic subjects were determined for nasal patency, secretion weight, pulmonary function, eustachian tube function, middle-ear function, and symptoms after intranasal inhalation challenges with histamine, bradykinin, methacholine, prostaglandin D2, and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha).
 Results demonstrated that challenge with PGF2 alpha increased nasal patency, whereas challenge with all other substances decreased patency.
 The relationship between substances in eliciting a nasal congestive response was prostaglandin D2 greater than histamine greater than bradykinin greater than methacholine.
 A similar effect ordering was noted for the postchallenge development of eustachian tube dysfunction.
 Secretion weights were significantly greater after challenge with histamine compared to all other substances.
 A decrease in pulmonary function was observed only after challenge with PGF2 alpha, although the effect was not statistically significant.
 No changes in middle-ear pressure were observed for challenges with any of the substances.
 Only histamine challenge provoked sneezing, whereas challenge with either of the prostaglandins provoked cough.
 With the exception of methacholine, all substances caused symptoms of rhinorrhea, congestion, and sore throat.
 Bradykinin was particularly effective in provoking ""pain/pressure""-related symptoms.
 With the exception of secretion weight, the differences between responses of atopic and nonatopic subjects were not statistically significant.
 These results document mediator specificity in the physiologic and symptomatic responses to intranasal challenge.

"Pharmacokinetics of intravenous pentamidine in patients with normal renal function or receiving hemodialysis.
 The pharmacokinetics of intravenous pentamidine were studied in 10 patients with normal renal function (group 1), 9 volunteer subjects without Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who were receiving maintenance hemodialysis (group 2), and 5 patients with normal or mildly abnormal renal function (group 3) after the last dose of therapy.
 The concentration-time data were best represented by a three-compartment model.
 The peak plasma concentration, plasma clearance, and elimination half-life ranged from 249 +/- 80 to 227 +/- 110 ng/ml, 268 +/- 70 to 329 +/- 58 l/h, and 29 +/- 25 to 118 +/- 119 h, respectively, in groups 1 and 2.
 In group 1, trough concentration increased progressively (linear regression: y = 4.4x; r = .91, P = .001) without achieving steady state, and the renal clearance-to-plasma clearance ratio was 2.1% +/- 0.01%.
 In group 3, the elimination half-life after the last dose was 12.0 +/- 2.3 days.
 The elimination half-life of pentamidine was long and accumulation occurred with daily dosing even in patients with normal renal function.
 Dose adjustment is not recommended for renal impairment as renal clearance accounts for a small fraction (2.1%) of plasma clearance.

"Palliation of malignant tracheal strictures using silicone T tubes.
 The use of silicone T tubes for intubation of malignant tracheobronchial strictures may provide some degree of palliation of this distressing condition.
 It was used in seven patients with malignant lesions and two with benign strictures (resulting from tracheal trauma and lung transplantation).
 Four patients (two with cancer) are still alive and well with the tube in position.
 All patients noted improvement in dyspnoea and stridor.
 The main problems were tube migration (one patient), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (one patient), and blockage of the tube by tumour (two patients) or encrusted secretions (three patients).
 Airway patency was restored when the tube was blocked by cleaning or by laser resection of the tumour.
 With careful supervision and education of the patient intubation can give useful palliation to patients with distressing upper airways obstruction.

"Prophylactic use of high-frequency percussive ventilation in patients with inhalation injury.
 Death and the incidence of pneumonia are significantly increased in burn patients with inhalation injury, despite application of conventional ventilatory support techniques.
 The effect of high-frequency percussive ventilation on mortality rate, incidence of pulmonary infection, and barotrauma were studied in 54 burn patients with documented inhalation injury admitted between March 1987 and September 1990 as compared to an historic cohort treated between 1980 and 1984.
 All patients satisfied clinical criteria for mechanical ventilation.
 High-frequency percussive ventilation was initiated within 24 hours of intubation.
 The patients' mean age and burn size were 32.2 years and 47.8%, respectively (ranges, 15 to 88 years; 0% to 90%).
 The mean number of ventilator days was 15.3 +/- 16.7 (range, 1 to 150 days), with 26% of patients ventilated for more than 2 weeks.
 Fourteen patients (25.9%) developed pneumonia compared to an historic frequency of 45.8% (p less than 0.005).
 Mortality rate was 18.5% (10 patients) with an expected historic number of deaths of 23 (95% confidence limits of 17 to 28 deaths).
 The documented improvement in survival rate and decrease in the incidence of pneumonia in patients treated with prophylactic high-frequency ventilation (HFV), as compared to a cohort of patients treated in the 7 years before the trial, indicates the importance of small airway patency in the pathogenesis of inhalation injury sequelae and supports further use and evaluation of HFV.

"Itraconazole in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis.
 Sixteen patients with coccidioidomycosis were treated with itraconazole for one year.
 Sixteen suffered from pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, two of them had associated mediastinal lesions, and one suffered from skin coccidioidomycosis.
 The daily dose used was 400 mg during the one-year period.
 Patients were clinically evaluated every month and tested for mycosis every three months.
 All patients except for one showed negative cultures on the third month after treatment began.
 Effectiveness achieved was excellent in eight patients (50 percent); a very good response was found in seven patients (44 percent); no response was seen in one patient (6 percent).
 There were four (25 percent) relapses and one dropout.
 Side effects seen were high blood pressure (19 percent) and lower limb edema (6 percent), which was temporary and at no time required discontinuing the drug therapy.
 We believe that itraconazole is an effective drug to treat coccidioidomycosis with a wide safety margin.
 It is well tolerated, and the incidence of relapses was low.

"Current epidemiology of pertussis in Japan.
 Since the introduction of whole cell pertussis vaccine into general use as part of the routine immunization in 1947 under the Preventive Immunization Law, a steady decrease in reported cases of pertussis was noted until 1974.
 At that time the number of reported cases reached an all time low and no deaths caused by pertussis were reported.
 The vaccine (diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine) had been given to infants 12 weeks old or older in a 0.5-ml dose by deep subcutaneous injection; three doses were given at intervals of 3 to 8 weeks and the fourth dose (booster) was given 12 to 18 months after the third dose.
 The immunization was completed with those four doses.
 Because whole cell vaccine appeared to be associated with severe neurologic illnesses, it was temporarily suspended in 1975.
 The vaccine was resumed soon thereafter but the age of administration was raised to 24 to 48 months.
 Under these circumstances acceptance rates of pertussis occurred, reaching a peak in 1979.
 Although whole cell vaccine was used even after temporary suspension, it was considered to be unacceptable by the public.
 As a result the acellular pertussis vaccine was developed and has totally replaced whole cell vaccine since 1981.
 A steady decrease in reported cases of pertussis as well as the number of deaths has been noted since 1979 in accordance with increase in vaccine acceptance rates.
 The national surveillance system begun in 1981 demonstrated also a steady decrease in the incidence of pertussis during the past 9 years.

 = 20.94 counts/voxel) for phantoms of 25 to 127 cc and concentrations of 0.13 to 9.5 microCi/cc.
 The in vivo, in vitro correlation of 131I concentrations in the urine was also good (r = 0.98, s.e.e.

 The radiation dose for thyroid carcinoma metastases varied between 6.3 and 276.9 rad/mCi.
 The dose from MIBG varied between 13.4 and 57.8 rad/mCi.
 These results indicate the validity of quantitative SPECT for in vivo measurement of 131I and the need to measure the concentration of 131I in individual human tumor sites.

"Increased levels of serum interferon-gamma in pulmonary sarcoidosis and relationship with response to corticosteroid therapy.
 The aim of this study was to evaluate serum levels of the lymphokine interferon-gamma (IFNg) in patients with chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis, and to investigate its value as a predictive marker of clinical response to corticosteroid therapy.
 Twenty-five patients and 28 age-matched control subjects were studied.
 All the patients had parenchymal shadows (Stage II or Stage III) and none had clinical evidence of extrathoracic disease.
 Before therapy, serum IFNg levels were significantly higher in the patient group (p less than 0.001), and 20 (80%) had values above the normal range.
 After oral treatment with corticosteroids for a median 13 months (range, 3 to 49 months) the levels decreased significantly (p less than 0.01).
 However, the falls were less pronounced in patients who had a better outcome in terms of achieving complete radiographic resolution and in those who improved in forced vital capacity by greater than or equal to 10%.
 The prognostic value of the pretreatment serum IFNg was explored, and a significant relationship was found between higher pretreatment levels and lower grades or radiographic abnormality assessed 3 yr after commencement of treatment (p less than 0.01).
 In addition, the patients who had cleared completely while receiving steroids and remained in remission had significantly higher pretreatment serum IFNg levels than did those with incomplete resolution of parenchymal shadows or radiographic relapses (p less than 0.05).
 We conclude that elevated levels of circulating IFNg are detectable in most untreated patients with Stage II/III pulmonary sarcoidosis and that patients with the highest levels appear to have a better chance of achieving complete resolution with corticosteroid therapy.

"Flow and volume dependence of respiratory system mechanics during constant flow ventilation in normal subjects and in adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 Seven control subjects and seven patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were artificially ventilated and flow, volume, and tracheal pressure were monitored.
 Respiratory system resistance (Rrs,max) was partitioned into its homogeneous (Rrs,min) and uneven (Rrs,u) components.
 Respiratory system elastance (Ers) was also measured.
 In both groups Ers did not vary with different inspiratory flows and volumes, but was significantly higher in ARDS.
 With increasing volume (isoflow maneuvers), Rrs,max and Rrs,u increased but Rrs,min remained unaltered in ARDS.
 In control patients, however, resistances did not vary but Rrs,max and Rrs,u were smaller and Rrs,min equaled their corresponding values in ARDS.
 Hence, stress relaxation seems to be increased in ARDS.
 During isovolume maneuvers Rrs,max and Rrs,u decreased with increasing flows (both groups), although they were significantly higher in ARDS.
 Rrs,min was not modified by different flows and was similar in both groups.
 Thus, pendelluft is also increased in ARDS.
 In conclusion, the mechanical profile of ARDS is characterized by increased Ers and Rrs,max, the latter being secondary to augmented mechanical unevenness within the system.

 Unfortunately, the pharmacologic management remains largely empiric with sympathomimetics, anticholinergics, methylxanthines, and corticosteroids.

"Oral corticosteroid therapy for patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A meta-analysis 
 PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of oral corticosteroid therapy in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1966 to 1989) and a bibliographic review of all retrieved articles identified 33 original studies of oral corticosteroid use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease published since 1951.
 STUDY SELECTION: We submitted a photocopy of each study's ""methods"" section to three nonstudy physician-investigators who used nine explicit criteria to independently assess study quality.
 Ten studies met all criteria and five studies met some of the criteria.
 DATA EXTRACTION: To compare outcomes across all qualifying studies, we defined response to therapy as a 20% or greater increase in the baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); we defined the treatment effect size for each study as the proportion of patients who responded to corticosteroid therapy minus the proportion of patients who responded to placebo.
 Potential confounding variables as related to eligibility criteria and treatment protocols were also assessed for each study.
 RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among ten studies that met all nine criteria, we found no significant differences in eligibility criteria, treatment protocol, or study design.
 No association was found between treatment effect size and publication date, study size, mean patient age, or FEV1.
 These studies had reported effect sizes ranging from 0% to 56%; we calculated a weighted mean effect size of 10% (95% CI, 2% to 18%).
 When studies meeting only some of the criteria were included in the calculation, the weighted mean effect size was 11% (95% CI, 4% to 18%).
 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving oral corticosteroid therapy have a 20% or greater improvement in baseline FEV1 approximately 10% more often than similar patients receiving placebo.

 Symptoms ranged from recurrent stridor and wheezing to severe respiratory compromise and hypercarbia.
 Routine chest x-rays were not diagnostic.
 Definitive diagnosis was made by bronchoscopy, which showed complete tracheal rings in all patients with severely compromised tracheobronchial lumens.
 In three patients, pericardium was successfully used for anterior tracheoplasty with one early death due to fulminant sepsis in an infant with undiagnosed sickle cell disease.

 All sepsis patients were culture positive, 6 of 13 from the blood.
 Both renal failure and ARDS developed in 54 percent of septic patients.
 51Cr-labelled neutrophils were prepared and added to bovine pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers with and without added phorbol myristate acetate.
 Endothelial cells with adherent PMA and nonadherent PMN's, were harvested and radioactivity in each fraction measured with a gamma scintillation counter.
 Baseline and maximally stimulated (PMA, 3.0 ng/ml) neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells were similar in all patients groups.
 However, in septic patients, PMA-stimulated PMN adherence was reduced at lower doses, most significantly in those who developed ARDS within 24 to 48 hours of admission (p less than 0.05).
 Seventy-one percent of patients who developed ARDS had reduced stimulated adherence (PMA 1.0 ng/ml) compared to 22 percent of critically ill patients who did not.
 We conclude that diminished adherence of neutrophils to endothelium in response to low-level PMA stimulation is significantly more common in patients with sepsis who develop ARDS.
 Our findings suggest that PMN-endothelial cell interaction is altered by the time sepsis is clinically recognized but before the development of ARDS.
 We speculate that the observed reduction in adherence of the PMN to endothelial cells may be a consequence of down-regulation by mediators generated in the inflammatory response to sepsis and/or the need for active participation of septic endothelium in this interaction.

"The role of leukotriene antagonists and inhibitors in the treatment of airway disease.
 Since the early recognition that leukotrienes are generated in response to allergen exposure, a role for these multipurpose mediators has been sought.
 The pharmacologic actions of the leukotrienes and their cell sources were strong evidence that they should contribute to allergic airway disease.
 That promise is now being fulfilled.
 Potent leukotriene receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors of leukotriene generation are now being investigated.
 With the availability of these new compounds, not only will greater insight to leukotrienes in asthma become apparent, but possibly newer, more effective therapeutics.
 Of additional interest and relevance is the potential role of leukotrienes in other nonrespiratory inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.
 Therefore, the role of leukotrienes in inflammation is not limited to the respiratory system but are more universal in their ability to cause tissue injury.
 Consequently, studies that have shown benefit from inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and antagonism of the LTD4 receptor in respiratory diseases are suggestive that such an approach will also be beneficial in other inflammatory diseases.
 For example, a study of 72 patients with A-64077 (zileuton) has demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
 Therefore, the contribution of leukotrienes to inflammation is likely to be a global phenomenon, and the introduction of leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may represent the beginning of a new era for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases.

"Intraluminal irradiation for the palliation of lung cancer with the high dose rate micro-Selectron.
 Fifty patients with inoperable, symptomatic endobronchial carcinoma were treated by a single exposure of intraluminal radiotherapy.
 A high dose rate afterloading system (the micro-Selectron-HDR) was used to minimise radiation exposure for staff.
 Haemoptysis was relieved in 24 of 28 patients, breathlessness in 21 of 33 patients, and cough in nine of 18 patients.
 Radiological collapse resolved in 11 of 24 patients.
 Treatment was given on an outpatient basis and was well tolerated.
 Intraluminal radiotherapy appears to offer an effective alternative to conventional fractionated external beam radiotherapy.

 The cause of bleeding in a patient with recurrent massive hemoptysis was not apparent after bronchoscopy and gross examination of the lobectomy specimen.
 Histologic submission of all major bronchi uncovered dilated, tortuous bronchial arteries just below the bronchial mucosa with sites of both current and healing arterial rupture.
 This bronchial arterial abnormality is common to several chronic pulmonary diseases, but is rarely diagnosed as a cause of massive hemoptysis.
 Careful pathologic examination of major bronchi in the setting of hemoptysis of unknown causation is recommended.

"Manual ventilation bags as a source for bacterial colonization of intubated patients.
 A group of 14 intensive care unit (ICU) patients were studied to determine if manual ventilation bags (MVB) could serve as a source of bacterial or fungal pathogens that could colonize the respiratory tract of intubated patients.
 A total of 51 cultures were simultaneously obtained of patient's sputum, the exterior MVB surface, MVB port, and MVB interior (postexhalation valve).
 Pathogens colonizing or infecting the respiratory tract of intubated ICU patients were frequently simultaneously present on the exterior surface of the MVB and inside the MVB port used to connect the MVB with the endotracheal tube.
 In addition, coagulase-negative staphylococci and yeast were frequently present on the exterior surface of the MVB.
 The interior of the MVB was usually sterile.
 In three instances pathogens were isolated from the MVB before isolation from the patient's sputum.
 MVB may serve as a source for colonizing the respiratory tract of intubated ICU patients and/or the hands of medical personnel.
 The exterior surface and port of MVB should be cleaned of visible debris and disinfected at least once a day.

 Although lower respiratory tract infections are frequently diagnosed in a primary care setting, they are still associated with a significant morbidity and mortality, which warrants a careful approach to treatment.
 Knowledge of the most common cause based on the age of the patient, location where the infection was acquired, and clinical presentation helps to direct empiric treatment.
 A few basic laboratory studies, especially a sputum Gram stain, can allow for more specific treatment.

"Air travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Air travel exposes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the risk of severe hypoxemia.
 We sought to determine the frequency and outcome of airline travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 A cohort of 100 patients (76 men and 24 women; age 67 +/- 7 years [mean +/- SD]) with severe chronic pulmonary obstructive disease examined by means of spirometry (forced expiratory volume in the first second, 0.04 +/- 0.35 L), all military retirees, or their dependents, comprised the study population.
 Forty-four patients traveled by commercial air carrier over a 28-month interval, giving an annual frequency of 18.9% of these patients per year.
 The group that did not travel by air (n = 56) had a lower mean value for forced expiratory volume in the first second and greater prevalence of home oxygen use than did the group that did travel by air.
 Twelve of the travelers (27.3%) consulted a physician beforehand.
 Flights reached foreign destinations for 22.7% of patients.
 The median duration of the longest flight segment was 3 hours.
 A minority of patients (34.3%) occupied seats in the smoking sections of aircraft.
 A majority (56.8%) ambulated aboard the aircraft during flights.
 Eight patients (18.2%) reported transient symptoms during air travel.
 We conclude that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travel with appreciable frequency, often without medical consultation, and develop symptoms in some cases.

 The peri-operative anaesthetic management of 11 patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing single-lung transplantation is presented.
 Intra-operative problems, the early postoperative phase of recovery and intensive care, and other incidents in which general anaesthesia was required for the management of complications, are featured.
 Results, both short- and long-term, are mentioned.
 Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure.
 Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure.

"Neural respiratory drive and neuromuscular coupling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 In 15 spontaneously breathing patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) divided into two groups, one with normocapnia (A) and one with chronic hypercapnia (B), we evaluated the maximal voluntary inspiratory muscle strength (MIP), the pattern of breathing, the mouth occlusion pressure (Po.1), the neural respiratory drive (NRD), assessed by surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the diaphragm (EMGd) and EMG activity of intercostal muscles (EMGint), and the chest wall neuromuscular coupling, assessed in terms of Po.1/EMGd ratio.
 Compared with an age-matched normal control group, both A and B groups exhibited lower MIP, significantly greater EMGd and EMGint, and lower Po.1/EMGd ratio.
 However, a similar pattern, along with a rapid and shallow breathing, differentiated group B from group A.
 In group B we found a significant direct relationship between Po.1/EMGd ratio and MIP, and an inverse relationship between PaCO2 and Po.1/EMGd ratio.
 These data seem to indicate the following: (1) EMG is a more precise method than Po.1 in assessing the magnitude of the NRD; (2) NRD is increased in these patients; and (3) clinical manifestations probably associated with inspiratory muscle fatigue (marked decrease in muscle strength, rapid and shallow breathing, and alveolar hypoventilation) may be accompanied by a greater NRD and a more marked derangement in chest wall neuromuscular coupling in COPD.

"Transbronchial biopsies in children after heart-lung transplantation.
 Sixty transbronchial biopsies have been performed in eight children after heart-lung transplantation.
 The selection of fiber-optic bronchoscope or a small (4 mm; 30 cm) rigid bronchoscope was made according to the size of endotracheal tube required at surgery.
 If the endotracheal tube was size 7.5 or greater, a fiber-optic bronchoscope was used, whereas if the endotracheal tube size was below 7, a rigid bronchoscope was used.
 For the diagnosis of lung rejection, the histology of biopsies revealed a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 69% (similar to the result in adults).
 The histology also distinguished lung infection from rejection.
 Complications included three pneumothoraces and two clinically significant episodes of hemorrhage, one of which led to a cardiorespiratory arrest, which may have been caused by hypoxia.
 As a result, arterial oxygen saturation is now monitored during the procedure using a pulse oximeter.

"Effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-induced thrombolysis in canine pulmonary embolism.
 We employed a canine model of pulmonary embolism induced by radioactive blood clots to determine if low-molecular-weight heparin augments recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-induced thrombolysis.
 Following embolization, dogs were randomized: group 1 dogs received heparin; group 2 dogs received low-molecular-weight heparin; group 3 dogs received 1.5 mg/kg of rtPA over 45 minutes; group 4 dogs received rtPA 3 mg/kg over 45 minutes; and group 5 dogs received 1.5 mg/kg of rtPA plus low-molecular-weight heparin.
 Over three hours, little thrombolysis occurred in groups 1 and 2.
 In contrast, significant thrombolysis occurred in groups 3 to 5, 46 percent, 49 percent, and 46 percent, respectively (all p less than 0.01 compared with groups 1 and 2).
 We conclude that there is an upper limit to the dose-thrombolytic rate relationship with rtPA, and that low-molecular-weight heparin does not augment rtPA-induced thrombolysis.

"Distinguishable types of dyspnea in patients with shortness of breath.
 Dyspnea frequently accompanies a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 Although dyspnea is often considered a single sensation, alternatively it may encompass multiple sensations that are not well explained by a single physiologic mechanism.
 To investigate whether breathlessness experienced by patients represents more than one sensation, we studied 53 patients with one of the following seven conditions: pulmonary vascular disease, neuromuscular and chest wall disease, congestive heart failure, pregnancy, interstitial lung disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Patients were asked to choose descriptions of their sensation(s) of breathlessness from a dyspnea questionnaire listing 19 descriptors.
 Cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings among the chosen descriptors.
 We found that patients could distinguish different sensations of breathlessness.
 In addition, we found an association between certain groups of descriptors and specific conditions producing dyspnea.
 These findings concur with those in an earlier study in normal volunteers in whom dyspnea was induced by various stimuli.
 We conclude that different types of dyspnea exist in patients with a variety of cardiopulmonary abnormalities.
 Furthermore, different mechanisms may mediate these various sensations.

"Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma in patients with AIDS: scintigraphic diagnosis with sequential thallium and gallium scanning.
 Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is difficult to diagnose because the clinical presentations and radiographic findings are nonspecific.
 The authors report three proved cases of AIDS-associated pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma diagnosed with sequential thallium and gallium scans.
 These scans demonstrated abnormal increase of pulmonary thallium uptake, whereas the gallium uptake was negative.
 In the authors' experience and in reports in the radiology literature, infected areas of the chest are generally thallium-negative on the delayed (3-hour) scans but are gallium-avid, whereas lymphomas are both thallium- and gallium-avid.
 The authors conclude that sequential thallium and gallium scans can be used to help diagnose pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma and distinguish it from other common AIDS-associated chest complications such as lymphoma and infections.

"Importance of sampling method in DNA analysis of lung cancer.
 Lung carcinomas are characterised by considerable histological variation within the tumour.
 The possible effects of this morphological heterogeneity on the estimation of tumour ploidy were investigated.
 Multiple tissue blocks were systematically taken from 20 lung tumours and analysed by flow cytometry.
 The routine, archival paraffin wax embedded diagnostic blocks from these cases were also analysed.
 Nineteen (95%) of the tumours were shown to contain aneuploid stemlines by systematic sampling, but if only one of these systematic tissue blocks had been taken from each case the incidence of DNA aneuploidy could have been as low as 45%.
 Only 15 (75%) tumours were aneuploid when all the routine archival blocks were analysed, but by specifically selecting tumour areas from the archival material the accuracy of this method was increased to 90%.
 It is concluded that tumour sampling methods are of primary importance in assessing the DNA content of lung tumours.
 Routine paraffin wax embedded archival tissue provides a suitable source of material for this purpose, provided that ""turnover"" selection is carried out.

"Sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: results of a nationwide survey.
 A postal questionnaire inquiring about routine sedation and premedication practice for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was sent to 1048 doctors.
 Of 665 appropriate returns, 81% were from consultant physicians and surgeons.
 Most endoscopists (90%) reported using an intravenous benzodiazepine for at least three quarters of endoscopies and 54% of physicians and 69% of surgeons always did so.
 Midazolam was the intravenous sedative used by a third of all respondents and 13% also used an additional intravenous agent, usually pethidine.

 Adverse outcomes were reported more frequently by consultant physicians, by those who 'titrated' the intravenous sedative, and by those who used an additional intravenous agent, but were reported equally frequently by endoscopists using midazolam and endoscopists using diazepam.
 There is an urgent need for a prospective study to identify the circumstances and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes related to endoscopy.

"Drug-related pulmonary toxicity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Comparative results with three different treatment regimens.
 Pulmonary toxicity may complicate the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
 The possible drug-related cause of pulmonary toxicity was investigated retrospectively in 207 NHL patients treated between 1981 and 1988 with three regimens containing cyclophosphamide with and without methotrexate or bleomycin: methotrexate, calcium, leucovorin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (m-BACOD) (n = 134); methotrexate, calcium, leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (m-ACOD) (n = 43); or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) (n = 30) chemotherapy.
 These regimens contained the same drugs and were administered in the same schedule; the regimens differed primarily in the addition of bleomycin or methotrexate.
 Pulmonary toxicity occurred in 24 of 134 (18%) m-BACOD-treated and in six of 43 (14%) m-ACOD-treated patients (P = 0.65).
 Chest radiography revealed diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in 16 (67%) and six (100%) of the m-BACOD-treated and m-ACOD-treated patients with pulmonary toxicity, respectively.
 None of the CHOP-treated patients had pulmonary toxicity.
 The clinical features of pulmonary toxicity and the amount of chemotherapy administered before it occurred did not differ in patients treated with m-BACOD or m-ACOD, although the toxicity tended to be more severe in the m-BACOD group.
 Open lung or transbronchial biopsies done in six (38%) of the m-BACOD-treated and three (50%) of the m-ACOD-treated patients with pulmonary infiltrates revealed nonspecific pneumonitis compatible with drug-related toxicity.
 In summary, these results showed that pulmonary toxicity during m-BACOD and m-ACOD therapy occurred with similar frequency and clinicopathologic features.
 This suggested that bleomycin was not responsible uniquely for the pulmonary toxicity in m-BACOD-treated patients.
 That pulmonary toxicity was not observed in patients treated with CHOP suggested that methotrexate may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary toxicity.

"Chronic inflammation is associated with an increased proportion of goblet cells recovered by bronchial lavage.
 To evaluate the possibility that bronchoalveolar lavage could provide sufficient respiratory epithelial cells to quantify changes in epithelial cell types associated with chronic inflammation, we examined the epithelial cells obtained in the first infused (20 ml) aliquots that were processed separately from later aliquots, a process known to enrich for bronchial contents.
 Epithelial cells, including ciliated cells, goblet cells, and fragments of desquamated epithelium, were easily identified after preparation by cytocentrifugation and staining with a modified Giemsa stain.
 Quantification of the columnar cell types revealed that those with chronic bronchitis and asymptomatic smokers have increased goblet cells as a percentage of the total columnar epithelial cells (chronic bronchitics 36 +/- 2 percent, asymptomatic smokers 22 +/- 2 percent) compared with normal subjects (9 +/- 1 percent, p less than 0.001, ANOVA).
 Significantly, the goblet cell percentage was strongly correlated with other measures of bronchitis and measures of airflow obstruction such as the bronchitis index, a visually derived score at bronchoscopy of airway inflammation (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001), the percent neutrophils in the first infused aliquots (r = 0.44, p less than 0.05), and the FEV1 percent (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001).
 Thus, bronchoalveolar lavage is capable of providing sufficient bronchial epithelial cells for analysis, and the changes seen in the spectrum of columnar epithelial cells may reflect important underlying pathologic changes.

"Manual translaryngeal jet ventilation and the risk of aspiration in a canine model.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: Manual translaryngeal jet ventilation (TLJV) is a safe and effective method of maintaining normal ventilation in apneic subjects.
 Little data exist on the amount of airway protection afforded with this technique of airway management.
 We sought to evaluate the risk of aspiration during manual TLJV.
 SETTING: Data were collected in a laboratory animal model.
 DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trial was performed.
 PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen adult apneic mongrel dogs were enrolled.
 INTERVENTIONS: Intratracheal Gastrograffin was instilled and radiographic changes assessed during ventilation using a 0 to 3 scale (none to severe).
 Thirty-six trials were performed, with equal numbers at both 30 degrees and 45 degrees head elevation.
 The three groups studied were animals without airway protection (control), animals with a cuffed endotracheal tube (tube), and animals with a percutaneous TLJV cannula and a 50-psi oxygen source ventilated at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (jet).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Significantly less radiographic evidence of aspiration was noted in the jet and tube groups at 30 degrees and 45 degrees compared with control animals (P = .002 each).
 At 45 degrees head elevation a trend toward increased aspiration scores in the jet group compared with the tube group (P = .065) was observed.
 CONCLUSION: In our model, manual TLJV at 20 breaths per minute and an I:E ratio of 1:2 provided protection from aspiration comparable to that observed with a cuffed endotracheal tube at 30 degrees head elevation.
 At 45 degrees elevation, this protection was diminished.

"Reductions in exercise lactic acidosis and ventilation as a result of exercise training in patients with obstructive lung disease.
 Though exercise training is part of most pulmonary rehabilitation programs, whether there is a physiologic basis for increased exercise tolerance is unclear.
 We sought to determine whether patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are capable of obtaining a physiologic training effect, as manifested by a reduction in blood lactate and ventilation (VE) at a given level of exercise.
 We also sought to determine whether training work rate determines the size of the training effect.
 Nineteen participants with COPD of predominantly moderate severity in an inpatient rehabilitation program performed two cycle ergometer exercise tests at a low and a high work rate for 15 min or to tolerance and also an incremental exercise test to tolerance.
 Arterial blood was sampled for blood gas and lactate analyses.
 Identical tests were performed before and after 5-day-per-week cycle ergometer training for 8 wk either for 45 min/day at a high work rate (average, 71 W) or for a proportionally longer time at a low work rate (average, 30 W).
 Average FEV1 was 56 +/- 12% predicted and did not change with training.
 Peak exercise lactate (average, 6.5 mEq/L) was not correlated with FEV1.
 For the high work rate training group, identical work rates engendered less lactate (4.5 versus 7.2 mEq/L) and less VE (48 versus 55 L/min) after training; the low work rate training group had significantly less lactate and VE decrease (p less than 0.01).
 Further, endurance time for the high constant work rate increased 73% in the high work rate training group but only 9% in the low work rate training group.
 At identical work rates, VE decrease average 2.5 L/min per mEq/L decrease in lactate (r = 0.75).
 We conclude that most COPD subjects studied increased blood lactate at low work rates.
 Many of these patients were able to achieve a physiologic training effect.
 Though total work was the same, training at a high work rate was more effective than was training at a low work rate.
 The lower VE requirement to perform exercise was in proportion to the lower lactate level, but the VE decrease for a given decrease in lactate was smaller than that seen in normal subjects (7.2 L/min/mEq/L), apparently because patients with COPD fall to hyperventilate in response to lactic acidosis (PaCO2 does not drop).
 These findings provide a physiologic rationale for exercise training of patients with COPD.

"Comparison of Papanicolaou's stain with the Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain for the cytodiagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.
 The cytodiagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii (PC) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids has traditionally required a special stain such as Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) stain.
 Recent reports indicate that identification of foamy alveolar casts (FACs) with Papanicolaou's (Pap) stain may provide a sensitive and less complicated way of making the diagnosis.
 To confirm these observations, results on a series of 318 BALs were reviewed.
 PC was identified on 65 (20%) specimens from 54 patients.
 Pap stains and GMS stains were positive on 56 (86%) of these BALs.
 Pap stains were positive on seven (11%) specimens that had negative GMS stains.
 PC was later confirmed on these specimens by other methods.
 Only two (3%) BALs had positive GMS stains and negative Pap stains.
 The results of this study confirm other reports that show that PC can be sensitively diagnosed with the Pap stain.
 The authors suggest that routine special stains for PC are unnecessary on BALs.

 The usefulness of clinical, radiologic, and physiologic characteristics to identify pathogens was assessed in 90 infants aged two through 12 weeks, presenting to an outpatient clinic with an acute respiratory infection.
 Eighty-four cases had cultures or rapid diagnostic tests for RSV, of which 25 were positive.
 Eighty-two infants had cultures or rapid diagnostic tests for Chlamydia, of which 16 were positive.
 Additional respiratory pathogens identified included parainfluenza (6 cases), rhinovirus (3 cases), pertussis (2 cases), and CMV (1 case).
 Multiple pathogens were identified in four cases: Chlamydia and RSV (2 cases), Chlamydia and parainfluenza (1 case), and Chlamydia and CMV (1 case).
 Clinical characteristics other than the need for hospitalization were not useful predictors of specific pathogens.
 X-rays were obtained in 20 (80%) of the RSV infections, 13 (81%) of the Chlamydia infections, six of the parainfluenza infections, two pertussis infections, and 25 cases without identification of the pathogen.

"Intact epithelial barrier function is critical for the resolution of alveolar edema in humans 
 Within 15 min of endotracheal intubation, the resolution of pulmonary edema was studied over the next 12 h in 34 mechanically ventilated patients by (1) serial measurements of the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, (2) the extent of edema on the initial and follow-up chest radiograph, and (3) by an initial and final measurement of total protein and albumin concentration in sequential samples of pulmonary edema fluid.
 Based on the oxygenation and chest radiographic data, 24 patients clinically improved and 10 patients did not improve.
 In the 10 patients who did not clinically improve (3, hydrostatic edema; 7, permeability edema), there was no change in the final edema fluid protein concentration (4.1 +/- 1.1 g/100 ml) compared with the initial edema fluid protein concentration (4.2 +/- 1.0 g/100 ml) (p = ns).
 However, in the 24 patients who clinically improved (15, hydrostatic edema; 9, permeability edema), there was an increase in every patient's final edema protein concentration (5.6 +/- 2.3 g/100 ml) compared with their initial edema protein concentration (3.8 +/- 1.2 g/100 ml) (p less than 0.01).
 In 13 of these 24 patients, the final edema fluid concentration (7.3 +/- 1.6 g/100 ml) exceeded the final plasma protein concentration (5.6 +/- 0.8 g/100 ml) by a mean value of 1.7 g/100 ml protein.

"Nasal and oral flow-volume loops in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
 Because flow-volume loops (FVLs) are clinically useful in evaluating upper airway (UA) obstruction and the fact that patency of the nasopharyngeal ventilatory pathway is important to the prevention of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the present study examined the role of nasal compared with oral FVLs in evaluating patients with OSA.
 Fourteen obese male patients 56 +/- 3 yr of age with a mean apnea plus hypopnea index (AHI) of 51 +/- 9/h were studied along with 14 nonobese, healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects whose mean AHI was 6 +/- 1/h.
 Nasal and oral FVLs obtained in the normal subjects indicated the nose behaved like a variable resistor, with flow limitation during inspiration but not during expiration.
 In the patient group, flow limitation was observed during expiration as well as inspiration indicating nondistensibility of the nasopharyngeal ventilatory pathway in the patients compared to the control subjects.
 A change in body position from upright to supine in the OSA group was associated with small reductions in expiratory but not inspiratory flow rates.
 The area under the nasal supine flow-volume loop (FVLANaSup) was found to be highly correlated with awake resting PaO2 (r = 0.80) and PaCO2 (r = -0.83) in the patient group.
 In addition, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that PaO2 and the area under the nasal FVLs independently contributed to the prediction of AHI with a multiple R of 0.89.
 These results suggest that limitations to ventilation via the nasopharynx may significantly influence both gas exchange and the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with OSA.

"Trimming of the inferior turbinates: a prospective long-term study.
 The aim of this study was to determine whether the initial benefits of radical trimming and anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates on nasal airflow persisted in the long term.
 Radical trimming significantly reduced nasal resistance at 2 months following operation (n = 12) (P less than 0.005).
 There was no significant change in nasal resistance over the next 20 months.
 Symptom scores for nasal obstruction also showed a significant reduction (n = 16) (P less than 0.005), at 2 months, and did not change significantly over the next 20 months.
 Radical trimming of the inferior turbinates is a highly effective operation in patients with hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates with few initial complications.
 However, further analysis of the data revealed that up to 20% of patients lose the initial subjective benefit of relief of nasal obstruction within 2 years of follow-up.
 Late onset crusting occurs in some patients though this is not directly attributable to an increase in nasal airflow.
 This study also concludes that anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates cannot be recommended as a form of treatment.

"Increased incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients with subclinical aspiration.
 Nosocomial pneumonia is frequent and is associated with high mortality in intubated mechanically ventilated patients.
 To determine whether there is a significant relationship between subclinical aspiration from nasogastric feeding and development of nosocomial pneumonia, we studied 24 ventilated patients who received nasogastric feeding.
 Endotracheal aspirates were tested twice daily for the presence of glucose using a glucose oxidase reagent strip.
 Subclinical aspiration was defined by the presence of glucose in nonbloody endotracheal aspirates.
 Nosocomial pneumonia was defined by the presence of all of the following conditions: (1) new or worsening infiltrate on chest roentgenogram consistent with pneumonia, (2) temperature greater than 38 degrees C and/or white blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm3 with 10% or more band forms, (3) culture of a new organism in the sputum, and (4) purulent tracheobronchial secretions.
 Twelve patients had no positive glucose tests of their endotracheal aspirates during their intensive care unit stay, one of whom developed nosocomial pneumonia.
 Twelve patients had endotracheal aspirates that were positive for glucose on 1 to 5 occasions.
 Of these patients, seven had bloody glucose-positive aspirates, four of whom developed clinical pneumonia.
 The remaining five patients had nonbloody glucose-positive endotracheal aspirates and all developed nosocomial pneumonia.
 There was a significantly greater incidence of pneumonia among patients who had nonbloody glucose-positive aspirates than among patients without glucose-positive aspirates (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test).
 We conclude that subclinical aspiration of nasogastric feeding, as detected by nonbloody glucose-positive endotracheal aspiration, is associated with the development of nosocomial pneumonia.

"Ciliary motility in two patients with yellow nail syndrome and recurrent sinopulmonary infections.
 The yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is described as a combination of yellow nails, chronic lymphedema, pleural effusions, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections, but all these features need not be present for the diagnosis.
 The mechanism that renders patients with this syndrome susceptible to respiratory infections is not known.
 To determine whether abnormal ciliary motility is a predisposing factor, in vitro ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in two patients with YNS and recurrent respiratory infections.
 In each case, the CBF was within normal limits (12 Hz).
 These data suggest that abnormal ciliary motility is not a pathophysiologic mechanism of recurrent sinopulmonary infections in YNS.

"Ligation of the superficial femoral vein in prevention of pulmonary embolism: an old fashion procedure?
 From 1974 to 1988, interruption of the superficial femoral vein (SFV) was performed to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE) in 73 patients.
 The mean age of the patients was 62 years.
 Phlebography showed thrombi in the following localizations: calf veins (67.3%), superficial femoral or popliteal veins (56.6%), common femoral veins (19.5%) and iliac veins (2.7%).
 A floating thrombus in the popliteal or femoral vein was the main indication for surgery in 97.3% of patients.
 Pulmonary embolism had occurred in 76.7% and was associated with neoplasm in 13.7%.
 Ligation of the SFV was performed in 93 limbs and completed iliac or femoral thrombectomy in 32.3%.
 The procedure was performed under locoregional anesthesia in 82.9% of the cases.
 Hospital mortality was 1.4% and 3 year survival, considering only PE related deaths was 95.3 +/- 2.7%.
 Follow-up was complete for all patients and averaged 3.0 years, for a 3 years PE-free rate of 90.8 +/- 3.6%.
 Persistent symptoms included increased limb tenseness in 12.5% and mild ankle edema in 25%.
 Bilateral strain-gauge plethysmography (SGP) was obtained in 65 limbs.
 The time necessary to obtain a 50, 75 and 100% decrease in calf volume (respectively T1/2, T3/4 and TT) was calculated for the operated limb and compared with the untreated limbs used as controls.
 A prolongation of T1/2 from 2.5 +/- 0.3 sec in controls to 4.3 +/- 0.4 sec in the operated limb (p less than 0.01) was found.
 Thus, our experience with ligation of the superficial femoral vein is favourable since long-term ill effects have been minimal and strain gauge plethysmography (SGP) showed only mildly altered venous drainage.

"Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism causing subacute cor pulmonale: a difficult antemortem diagnosis [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Apr;66(4):439]
 Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism is difficult to diagnose.
 The most common initial clinical symptom is subacute progressive dyspnea, and the initial laboratory evaluation typically shows hypoxemia in a patient with clear lung fields on a chest roentgenogram.
 Another distinguishing feature may be hepatic abnormalities.
 In general, pulmonary angiography discloses no evidence of emboli, but multiple subsegmental peripheral perfusion defects are noted on ventilation-perfusion lung scans.
 The diagnosis of microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism can be confirmed by open-lung or transbronchial lung biopsy or by microvascular pulmonary cytology, a less invasive procedure that could be performed at the time of pulmonary angiography.
 Herein we describe two patients with unsuspected microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism that eventuated in subacute cor pulmonale and death.
 These cases illustrate the characteristic findings of this entity and emphasize the need for early diagnosis.

 Stains were positive for corticotropin (ACTH) and gastrin in both the prostate and in the lung, but no evidence of excess secretion was documented.
 These findings are consistent with the notion that neuroendocrine activity is common in undifferentiated small cell carcinomas, regardless of their site of origin.

"Pleural penetration of ciprofloxacin in patients with empyema thoracis.
 We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a single 200-mg dose of ciprofloxacin, administered as a 30-minute infusion, into pleural exudate in five elderly patients with empyema thoracis.
 Ciprofloxacin was measured by HPLC and the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods.
 Mean peak serum levels 30 minutes after administration were 1.98 +/- 0.07 mg/L.
 Terminal serum half-lives ranged from 3.9 to 5.1 h.
 Mean concentrations of ciprofloxacin in pleural exudate were 1.44 +/- 0.42 mg/L at a mean time of 4.5 +/- 2.5 h.
 After this time, the pleural exudate level exceeded the corresponding serum twofold to tenfold.
 The mean percentage penetration into the inflammatory compartment was approximately 210 percent.
 Our data suggested that ciprofloxacin penetrates well into the pleural fluid of patients with empyema thoracis.
 The concentrations achieved were well above the MIC90 of most pathogens normally found in patients with empyema thoracis for a period of approximately 12 h.

 There was one hospital death.
 Palliation of dyspnea at rest was achieved in all patients, although 3 required oxygen with exertion.
 Four shunts became occluded between 1 and 10 months after placement.
 Two of these were replaced.

"Respiratory outcome in extremely premature infants following ketamine anaesthesia.
 Premature infants are prone to develop postoperative apnoea.
 The purpose of the present study was to determine if risk factors could be identified to predict which patients would require postoperative tracheal intubation and lung ventilation.
 Twenty-five extremely premature infants (birth weight: 811 +/- 242 g (mean +/- SD) and operation weight: 1585 +/- 394 g) needing cryotherapy for retinopathy were studied.
 After surgery the tracheas were extubated if there was no prolonged apnoea, SaO2 greater than 85%, and heart rate greater than 120 bpm.
 In eight, tracheal extubation in the operating room was unsuccessful.
 Using multivariate discriminant analysis, four risk factors correlated with the need for pulmonary ventilation-gestational duration, birth weight, postconceptional age, and preoperative aminophylline treatment for seven days.
 A scoring system using these factors successfully predicted the need for a tracheal tube after surgery in 92% of patients.
 It is concluded that the system may be clinically useful in the perioperative care of low-birth-weight infants as it identifies important variables for evaluating postoperative prolonged apnoea.

"Seasonality of disease in Kuwait.
 To compare the seasonal variation in total mortality and deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and malignant disease, data were collected from North-East Scotland (Grampian region) and Kuwait.
 Seasonal differences were similar, in both timing and degree, for total mortality and deaths from circulatory disease, but were greater in Kuwait for respiratory disease.
 Peak mortality was during winter in both areas: in Grampian, when the climate is most uncomfortable, and in Kuwait, when the climate is at its most comfortable.
 Socioeconomic changes in Kuwait have been accompanied by a rapid fall in the degree of seasonality (deseasonality) for both total and infant mortality.
 These findings suggest that mortality peaks in winter, not because of a seasonally low temperature, but because of a seasonal fall in mean temperature irrespective of the annual mean temperature.

"Typical and atypical bronchopulmonary carcinoids. A clinicopathologic and flow cytometric study.
 The clinicopathologic and flow cytometric characteristics of 47 bronchopulmonary carcinoids were assessed, relative to patient survival.
 Aneuploidy was associated more often with tumor size of greater than or equal to 3.0 cm (P less than 0.004) and lymph node (P less than 0.013) or vascular involvement (P less than 0.004).
 Also, an aneuploid DNA content was seen significantly more often in histologically atypical (79%) than in typical carcinoid neoplasms (18%) (P less than 0.0001).
 Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed that the histologic category (typical vs.
 atypical) and ploidy pattern were important prognostic indicators.
 Size of the primary tumor and the presence of vascular involvement were also significant predictors of outcome.
 Histologically atypical carcinoids with diploid DNA content pursued a less aggressive course than did their aneuploid counterparts.

 Pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of pulmonary emboli which partially resolved after thrombolytic therapy.
 Subsequent treadmill testing confirmed the absence of exercise-induced hypotension two months following treatment.
 This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary embolism as a potential cause of exercise-induced hypotension, since it can be successfully treated with thrombolytic agents weeks after the initial onset of symptoms.

"Is there ever a role for salvage operations in limited small-cell lung cancer?
 Combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation produces tumor regression in most patients with small-cell lung cancer, but the impact on survival has been small, and less than 20% of patients with limited disease survive 2 years.
 Survival time is extremely short after failure to respond or relapse after treatment.
 Local control remains a problem, with one third of patients having recurrence only at the primary site.
 In an attempt to prolong survival and perhaps achieve cure, we undertook surgical resection in 28 patients with limited small-cell lung cancer who did not have complete remission with standard treatment or who had only local recurrence after treatment.
 There were 28 patients, 22 male and six female, median age 61 years (range 41 to 76).
 All patients had been treated with chemotherapy and 13 had received preoperative radiotherapy to the primary site and mediastinum.
 Eight patients underwent an operation for relapse after complete remission.
 Five patients had had no response to treatment, three had had a slight response followed by progression during chemotherapy, and 12 had achieved partial response but had greater than 3 cm residual masses.
 Twelve patients required pneumonectomy, 15 lobectomy, one patient had unresectable disease, and two had bulky residual masses after the operation.
 Three others had microscopic residual disease.
 Pathologic examination showed only small-cell lung cancer in 18 patients, mixed small-cell and non-small-cell in four, and only non-small-cell lung cancer in six.
 There were only four patients with stage I disease, 10 with stage II, and 14 with stage III.
 The median survival from the date of diagnosis for the entire group is 105 weeks and from the date of operation, 74 weeks.
 The projected 5-year survival rate is 23%.
 The two patients with residual masses died with local progression, and distant metastatic disease developed in 17 others.
 One patient died at 6 years without recurrent disease.
 Eight patients are alive 2 to 5 years after diagnosis.
 Seven of these patients required only a lobectomy, four had stage I disease, two had stage II, and two had stage III disease.
 Five had pure small-cell lung cancer and three had mixed small-cell and non-small-cell tumors.
 All of the patients with pathologic stage I disease remain alive compared with one of 10 with stage II disease and two of 14 with stage III.
 In summary, relapse or failure to respond to chemotherapy may be due to non-small-cell lung cancer or a mixed tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

"Extent of pulmonary emphysema in man and its relation to the loss of elastic recoil.
 1.
 We assessed lung density, determined by computerized tomography, as a measure of emphysema and related this to lung function and measurement of the elastic recoil of the lung in normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.
 2.
 We found a significant correlation between measurements of elastic recoil pressure at 90% of total lung capacity and both the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (r = 0.70, P less than 0.001).
 Measurements of elastic recoil of the lung also correlated with lung density as measured by computerized tomography scanning (P less than 0.001).
 3.
 Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between the density of the lowest fifth percentile of the computerized tomography lung-density histogram, and both the natural logarithm of the shape parameter of the pressure-volume curve (P less than 0.01), and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (P less than 0.01).
 However, the mean computerized tomography lung density correlated, in addition, with the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs at 90% of total lung capacity (P less than 0.001).
 4.
 Since the elastic recoil pressure correlates with computerized tomography lung density, and hence with emphysema, and since elastic recoil pressure also correlates with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s, these results suggest that loss of elastic recoil is one determinant of airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.

"Clinical characteristics of high-grade lymphomas with immune genes in germline configuration.
 In a prospective study of 42 high-grade lymphomas which were categorized according to the Kiel classification, the clinical significance of immune genotyping was studied.
 Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements were investigated.
 In 33 cases the immune genotype confirmed the phenotype.
 In one case with equivocal phenotype a TCR beta-chain rearrangement proved the T-cell origin of the lymphoma.
 None of the cases showed a bigenotype.
 There were eight lymphomas with immunoglobulin and TCR beta-chain and gamma-chain genes in germline configuration, which were divided into a group of immature lymphomas and a group of lymphomas with a more mature phenotype.
 The immature lymphomas had widespread disease, rapid progression, and favorable prognosis after intensive chemotherapy.
 The group of T-cell and Ki-1 lymphomas with null-cell genotype was clinically heterogeneous.
 Three of four cases were secondary lymphomas after lymphomatoid papulosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, or Hodgkin's disease.
 All cases presented with extranodal involvement.
 Only one of these patients is in continuous remission.
 In conclusion, the lack of immunoglobulin and TCR beta-chain and gamma-chain gene rearrangements does not exclude the diagnosis of high-grade malignant lymphoma, especially in cases with unusual extranodal involvement.
 However, the DNA analysis identifies a null-cell genotype subset of high-grade lymphomas which may have clinical significance.

"Hemorrhagic disorder due to an isoniazid-associated acquired factor XIII inhibitor in a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
 A case is described of a 75-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who developed an inhibitor of coagulation factor XIII while taking isoniazid.
 The patient presented with a subcutaneous hematoma of the abdominal wall that extended from the xiphoid process to the symphysis pubis and measured 20 cm in diameter.
 Results of routine coagulation studies were normal with the exception of an increased solubility of the patient's plasma clot in 5M urea consistent with a deficiency of factor XIII activity.
 Persistence of the deficiency following a 1:2 dilution of the patient's plasma in normal plasma indicated the presence of an inhibitor.
 A sample of the patient's plasma was depleted of IgG by streptococcal protein G adsorption.
 The IgG-depleted plasma did not inhibit factor XIII activity, indicating that the inhibitory activity was not attributable to the underlying IgM paraprotein.
 The patient's purified IgG, on the other hand, inhibited factor XIII activity and the inhibitory activity could be neutralized by anti-IgG antibody.
 The patient's IgG also inhibited factor XIII-mediated incorporation of fluorescent monodansylcadaverine into casein.
 Binding of the patient's IgG to factor XIII concentrate was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the IgG that bound to the factor XIII was demonstrated to be polyclonal.
 Isoniazid was discontinued after the patient was admitted to the hospital.
 Cryoprecipitate infusion controlled bleeding and reduced the inhibitor titer by 50%.
 Treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone, followed by extracorporeal immunoadsorption over a staphylococcal protein A column, did not reduce the inhibitor titer further.
 Plasma exchange therapy reduced the inhibitor titer to undetectable levels but failed to restore factor XIII activity.
 Infusions of factor XIII concentrate reproducibly restored factor XIII activity and were not associated with an anamnestic rise in the inhibitor titer.
 This represents the seventh reported case of an acquired inhibitor to factor XIII associated with the ingestion of isoniazid.

"Pulmonary aspergillosis in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS.
 Symptomatic pulmonary aspergillosis has rarely been reported in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 We describe the predisposing factors, the clinical and radiologic features, and the therapeutic outcomes in 13 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis, all of whom had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and 12 of whom had AIDS.
 RESULTS.
 Pulmonary aspergillosis was detected a median of 25 months after the diagnosis of AIDS, usually following corticosteroid use, neutropenia, pneumonia due to other pathogens, marijuana smoking, or the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
 Two major patterns of disease were observed: invasive aspergillosis (in 10 patients) and obstructing bronchial aspergillosis (in 3).
 Cough and fever, the most common symptoms, tended to be insidious in onset in patients with invasive disease (median duration, 1.3 months before diagnosis).
 Breathlessness, cough, and chest pain predominated in the three patients with obstructing bronchial aspergillosis, who coughed up fungal casts.
 Radiologic patterns included upper-lobe cavitary disease (sometimes mistaken for tuberculosis), nodules, pleural-based lesions, and diffuse infiltrates, usually of the lower lobe.
 Transbronchial biopsies were usually negative, but positive cultures were obtained from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid or percutaneous aspirates.
 Dissemination to other organs occurred in at least two patients, and direct invasion of extrapulmonary sites was seen in two others.
 The results of treatment with amphotericin B, itraconazole, or both were variable.
 Ten of the patients died a median of 3 months after the diagnosis (range, 0 to 12 months).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Pulmonary aspergillosis is a possible late complication of AIDS; if diagnosed early, it may be treated successfully.

"Primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected people with CD4 counts below 200/mm3: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
 We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the effectiveness and costs of dapsone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or aerosolized pentamidine as initial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected people without prior symptoms AIDS and with CD4 counts less than 200/mm3.
 Each strategy increased life expectancy by about 18% compared with no prophylaxis; annual per-person costs were $440, $700, and $1,680 for dapsone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and aerosolized pentamidine, respectively.
 These cost differences make a strategy beginning with dapsone most cost effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,400 per life year saved compared with no prophylaxis.
 Aerosolized pentamidine was substantially less cost effective, but the incremental cost effectiveness ratios were highly dependent on estimates for quality of life, efficacy, toxicity, and compliance.
 We conclude that, based on currently available data, initial prophylaxis with either dapsone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is most cost effective.
 For every 100,000 people treated, starting prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or dapsone--with crossover to aerosolized pentamidine if oral therapy is not tolerated--may save between $98 million and $124 million per year.

 There were no complete responses.
 The response rate for CDDP plus VDS (22 of 77 patients, 29%) was significantly higher than that for CDDP alone (9 of 78 patients, 12%) (P less than 0.05).
 However, no difference existed in the median duration of response (20 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 20 weeks for CDDP alone) or the median survival time (45 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 39 weeks for CDDP alone).
 No significant differences in toxicity were detected between the two arms; myelosuppression, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy occurred more frequently with CDDP plus VDS and there was one lethal episode of hepatorenal syndrome in the CDDP plus VDS arm.
 Among the variables Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), age, sex, stage, weight loss, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, albumin level, histologic cell type, and chemotherapy arm, only chemotherapy arm was a significant factor leading to a major response (P = 0.019, multiple logistic regression analysis).
 The significant predictors of survival were PS (P = 0.000), sex (P = 0.000), and stage (P = 0.002) (Cox's proportional hazards model), with a PS of 0 or 1, female sex, and lower stage yielding the best survival.
 Although a significantly higher response rate was obtained in the combination arm than in the single agent arm, the survival benefit to patients receiving such combination chemotherapy was not determined and more effective chemotherapy regimens are required.

"Effects of epidermal growth factor and analogues of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and somatostatin on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues of specific protein substrates in various tumors.
 Analogues of somatostatin (SS) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) activate tyrosine phosphatases in MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell line membranes and inhibit growth.
 We compared the substrates phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to those dephosphorylated by the SS analogue RC-160 (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2) and [D-Trp6]LH-RH in cancer cell lines such as MIA PaCa-2 (human pancreatic cancer), HCPC (hamster cheek pouch carcinoma), A-549 (human lung cancer), HT-29 (human colon cancer), and R3230AC (breast cancer).
 EGF phosphorylated proteins of 170, 65, and 60 kDa and analogues of SS and LH-RH promoted the dephosphorylation of these proteins in MIA PaCa-2 and HCPC cell lines.
 The EGF receptor is 170 kDa.
 pp60src (60 kDa) is known to be a substrate for EGF receptor.
 The LH-RH receptor is also 60 kDa.
 The effects of RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH were quantitatively different.
 Examinations of HT-29, A-549, and R3230AC cancer cell lines revealed no phosphorylation by EGF or dephosphorylation by RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH.
 In addition to the 170-, 65-, and 60-kDa proteins, 35-kDa proteins were also phosphorylated in some cancer cell lines.
 This work demonstrates that analogues of SS and LH-RH can reverse the effects of EGF biochemically as well as functionally.

 In one county, 30-40% of the respiratory cancer and NMRD deaths were attributable to CAP.
 In this county, NMRD deaths (but not respiratory cancer deaths) were slightly more frequent than in Salt Lake County where smoking rates were twice as high.

"Morbidity and mortality of patients with AIDS and first-episode Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia unaffected by concomitant pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection.
 To determine the significance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pulmonary coinfection with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS, we examined the association of long- and short-term survival and morbidity (as defined by length of hospital stay) with recovery of CMV from bronchoscopy specimens and an indirect measure of virus titer in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (the time to develop CMV cytopathology in culture) in 111 patients diagnosed with a first episode of P.
 carinii pneumonia.
 Compared with 57 individuals from whom CMV was not isolated, the 54 individuals from whom CMV were isolated did not differ in baseline characteristics, long-term survival (213 versus 275 days, p = 0.97), acute death rate (19% in both, p = 1.0), or length of hospital stay (19.7 versus 21.1 days, p = 0.68).
 Also, the time to develop CMV cytopathology in culture did not correlate with acute or long-term survival.

"The reappearance of abdominal tuberculosis.
 Seventeen patients with abdominal tuberculosis were recently treated at our institution.
 Two distinct patient populations were identified--immigrants and individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
 Abdominal pain, weight loss and fever were the most common complaints, with abdominal tenderness and pyrexia the most frequent physical findings.
 Only five of 17 patients had concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis.
 A typical computed tomographic scan was helpful in the diagnosis.
 Diagnosis was made at emergency (five patients) or elective (six patients) laparotomy, by endoscopic (two patients) or percutaneous (three patients) biopsy or on the basis of roentgenologic and clinical evidence (one patient).
 All responded to antituberculous chemotherapy.
 With the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis has become increasingly frequent in urban areas and it must be suspected in all immigrants and patients with AIDS presenting with abdominal complaints.

"Glucose, K+, and albumin concentrations in the alveolar milieu of normal humans and pulmonary sarcoidosis patients.
 Some properties of the alveolar epithelial barrier during transalveolar transport of water and solutes were studied in normal humans and patients with sarcoidosis by means of the transalveolar capillary concentration gradients of various solutes.
 A total of 9 normal control subjects (Group A) and 60 sarcoidosis patients, 52 with an evolving disease (Group B) and 8 recovered (Group C), underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
 The second aliquot of fluid was used to measure urea, glucose, potassium, and albumin, which were also investigated in plasma.
 Urea was used to determine the volume of alveolar epithelial lining fluid (AELF volume).
 Results are expressed as the ratio of solute concentration in AELF over that in plasma (A/P ratio).
 In Group A there were clear concentration gradients of glucose, potassium, and albumin between the AELF and plasma, as the A/P ratios of glucose, potassium, and albumin were 0.02 +/- 0.006 (mean +/- SEM), 3.2 +/- 0.34, and 0.04 +/- 0.008, respectively.
 In Group B the A/P ratios of glucose (0.21 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.001) and albumin (0.17 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.001) were significantly increased but that of potassium remained unchanged (2.9 +/- 0.2).
 The A/P ratios of these various solutes were independent of chest x-ray typing.
 The albumin but not the glucose A/P ratio was correlated with the percentage of lymphocytes recovered from BAL (p less than 0.02); however, there was no correlation between the albumin A/P ratio and the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio.
 In group C there was a striking contrast between the albumin A/P ratio, which was normal, and the glucose A/P ratio, which was clearly elevated despite a normal lymphocyte count.

"Carcinoid tumors.
 The authors carried out a retrospective study of 32 patients (23 M, 9 F) with carcinoid tumors who were diagnosed and treated at Harlem Hospital Center, New York, from 1967 to 1988.
 All the patients were black and the commonest sites were the ileum (28.1%), rectosigmoid and rectum (21.9%), and the appendix and lung (15.6% each).
 Metastasis correlated with site, size, and depth of the primary tumor and occurred in 12 patients (38%), most frequently to the regional lymph nodes and liver.
 Carcinoid syndrome developed in 12.5% (3 F, 1 M).
 Surgical resection for cure or palliation was the mainstay of treatment.
 Overall 5 year survival rate was 66%, and for those with metastases was 0%.
 The poorer survival rates are probably related to the socioeconomic status of our patient population.
 The only observed racial difference compared to other series is the preponderance of males, and the disproportionately higher ratio of females with the carcinoid syndrome.

"Comparison of postoperative complications between saphenous vein and IMA grafts to left anterior descending coronary artery.
 Considerable controversy exists regarding relative morbidity associated with the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and internal mammary artery (IMA) graft in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization.
 As a part of the cooperative study on use of antiplatelet drugs for graft patency, operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected on 1,150 patients who underwent either SVG (n = 656) or IMA anastomosis (n = 494) to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 There were no differences in baseline characteristics of patients, distribution of randomization among treatment groups, and total number of distal anastomoses performed between the two groups.
 The aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, operative time, and chest tube drainage were greater (p = 0.0001) in the patients with IMA grafts compared with SVG.
 However, there was no difference in the operative mortality rate, the amount of blood and blood products received, the reoperation rate for control of postoperative bleeding, and incidence of wound complications between the two groups.
 The early and 1-year patency rates for the IMA were slightly but not significantly better than the SVG patency rates (92.8% versus 90.1% for 1-year patency; p = 0.309).
 In conclusion, use of IMA is associated with a longer operative time as well as increased postoperative bleeding compared with the SVG.
 It, however, does not increase operative mortality or postoperative morbidity.

"The South Karelia Air Pollution Study. The effects of malodorous sulfur compounds from pulp mills on respiratory and other symptoms.
 The paper mills in South Karelia, the southeast part of Finland, are responsible for releasing a substantial amount of malodorous sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and methyl sulfides [(CH3)2S and (CH3)2S2], into ambient air.
 In the most polluted residential area the annual mean concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan are estimated to be 8 and 2 to 5 micrograms/m3 and the highest daily average concentration 100 and 50 micrograms/m3.
 The annual mean and highest daily concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) are very low.
 We studied the effects of malodorous sulfur compounds on eye, nasal and respiratory symptoms, and headache in adults.
 A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire was distributed in February 1987 and responded to by 488 adults living in a severely (n = 198), a moderately (n = 204), and a nonpolluted community (n = 86).
 This included questions about occurrence of the symptoms of interest during the previous 4 wk and 12 months and individual, behavioral, and other environmental determinants of the symptoms.
 The response rate was 83%.
 The odds ratios (OR) for symptoms experienced often or constantly in severely versus nonpolluted and moderately versus nonpolluted communities were estimated in logistic regression analysis controlling potential confounders.
 The odds ratios for eye (moderate exposure OR 11.70, Cl95% 2.33 to 58.65; severe exposure OR 11.78, Cl95% 2.35 to 59.09) and nasal symptoms (OR 2.01, Cl95% 0.97 to 4.15; OR 2.19, Cl95% 1.06 to 4.55) and cough (OR 1.89, Cl95% 0.61 to 5.86; OR 3.06, Cl95% 1.02 to 9.29) during the previous 12 months were increased, with a dose-response pattern.

"Diagnostic relevance of trigeminal evoked potentials following infraorbital nerve stimulation.
 A new tool in neurophysiological exploration of the trigeminal nerve has recently been introduced.
 It has been demonstrated that stimulation of the infraorbital nerve trunk gives rise to very reliable scalp responses reflecting the activity of the afferent pathway between the maximally nerve and the brain stem.
 The authors demonstrate that alterations of such trigeminal evoked responses fit with documented pathological processes at various locations along the trigeminal pathway (maxillary sinus, parasellar region, and within the brain-stem parenchyma).
 They report the findings in 68 patients suffering from ""idiopathic"" trigeminal neuralgia.
 Alterations of the response were detected in 33 cases, suggesting that some damage of the nerve had taken place either at the root entry zone into the pons (23 cases) or slightly distal to it (10 cases).
 Such results support the hypothesis that trigeminal neuralgia may be due to a compression of the trigeminal root at the pons entry zone.

"Synergistic anti-Pneumocystis carinii effects of erythromycin and sulfisoxazole.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis was effectively prevented in 90% of immunosuppressed rats by the administration of 100 mg of erythromycin and 300 mg/kg/day of sulfisoxazole.
 All of the untreated control and erythromycin-treated animals developed the infection and 80% of rats given sulfisoxazole alone had the pneumonitis.
 A similar pattern of response occurred when the drugs were used therapeutically for rats with established P.
 carinii pneumonitis.
 The erythromycin and sulfisoxazole ratio of 1:3 was the most effective of several dose combinations tested.
 The established safety record from three decades of clinical use of this drug combination plus the broad spectrum of coverage for other causes of diffuse pneumonitis such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella warrant further study of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole in AIDS patients.

"Failure of dithiothreitol and pronase to reveal a false-positive cryptococcal antigen determination in cerebrospinal fluid.
 A patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a serum rheumatoid factor (RF) of 1:1,280 had a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) latex agglutination test (LAT) for cryptococcal antigen, in culture-negative, India-ink-negative CSF.
 Pretreatment of the sample of CSF with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) ablated the antigen titer and established the presence of a false-positive LAT, whereas CSF pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and pronase continued to yield a false-positive result.
 The differing ability of pronase, DTT, and 2-ME to eliminate interfering substances from CSF has not been previously described.
 Moreover, because RF is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, the authors postulated that malignant disease was responsible for the patient's false-positive LAT in CSF.
 Hence, the authors report the case to emphasize that false-positive LAT results in CSF are unlikely to be produced by RF and to underscore the benefit of using enzymatic and sulfhydryl-reducing agents when the validity of the initial test results are in doubt.
 Such a procedure will optimize the chances of accurately identifying false-positive LAT results in CSF.

 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by alveolar inflammation, exaggerated release of oxidants, and subnormal concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione in respiratory epithelial lining fluid (ELF).
 Glutathione (600 mg twice daily for 3 days) was given by aerosol to 10 patients with IPF.
 Total ELF glutathione rose transiently, ELF oxidised glutathione concentrations increased, and there was a decrease in spontaneous superoxide anion release by alveolar macrophages.
 Thus, glutathione by aerosol could be a means of reversing the oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in IPF.

"Changing disease patterns in patients with AIDS in a referral centre in the United Kingdom: the changing face of AIDS 
 OBJECTIVE--To study the changes in morbidity, mortality, and survival patterns in a population of patients with AIDS in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1989.
 DESIGN--A retrospective analysis of inpatient and outpatient records of patients with AIDS.
 SUBJECTS--347 Patients with AIDS, predominantly homosexual or bisexual men.
 SETTING--Departments of immunology and genitourinary medicine, St Mary's Hospital, London.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presenting diagnosis of AIDS, occurrence of other opportunist diseases, cause of death, and survival since AIDS was diagnosed, in particular for those patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or Kaposi's sarcoma.
 RESULTS--The overall proportion of patients who developed P carinii pneumonia dropped from 56% (20/36) in 1984 to 24% (46/194) in 1989, although it has remained the index diagnosis in about half of new patients.
 Kaposi's sarcoma has decreased as index diagnosis from 30% (20/67) to 20% (15/74) over the same period, though the prevalence has remained constant at around 35%.
 P carinii pneumonia accounted for 46% (16/35) of known causes of death in 1986 but only 3% (1/31) in 1989.
 Conversely, deaths due to Kaposi's sarcoma rose from 14% (1/7) to 32% (10/31) between 1984 and 1989.
 Lymphoma accounted for an increased proportion of deaths among these patients with 16% (5/31) of deaths in 1989.
 Their median survival increased from 10 months in 1984-6 to 20 months in 1987.
 CONCLUSIONS--The changing patterns of disease in patients with AIDS have important implications both for health care provision and future medical research.
 Medical and nursing provision must be made for the increased morbidity of these diseases and the increased survival of these patients.
 Research should now be directed towards developing effective treatments for the opportunist infections which are currently more difficult to treat, the secondary malignancies of AIDS, as well as more effective immunorestorative treatments.
 Future changes in disease patterns must be recognised at an early stage so that resources can be adequately planned and allocated.

"The influence of diazepam or lorazepam on the frequency of endotracheal intubation in childhood status epilepticus.
 Anticonvulsant management of status epilepticus (SE) may result in respiratory depression, often requiring endotracheal intubation (ETI).
 By examining rates of ETI in childhood SE after intravenous diazepam or lorazepam, when administered alone or in combination with phenytoin, the influence of anticonvulsants on the frequency of ETI during SE was determined.
 The medical records of 142 consecutive children younger than 16 years of age admitted from a university hospital ED with seizures during a 28-month period were retrospectively reviewed.
 SE was identified in 38 (27%) of cases.
 Records of children with SE were reviewed for demographic, seizure severity, and management variables.
 Twelve patients were excluded, ten of whom received concomitant phenobarbital.
 Patients receiving lorazepam had ETI rate of 27% (4/15), compared to 73% (8/11) in the diazepam group (P = 0.026, Fisher's exact).
 The groups were not significantly different in age, weight, sex, seizure type, seizure duration, and appropriate anticonvulsant dosage.
 A prospective, randomized trial comparing lorazepam and diazepam is warranted to confirm the apparent advantage of lorazepam in reducing respiratory depression.

"Urethral pressure and power generation during coughing and voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor in females with genuine stress incontinence.
 A probe which permits continuous measurement of the related values of pressure and cross-sectional area in the female urethra was used for a quantitative description of the adjunctive closure forces in terms of pressure and power generation during coughing and squeezing in 30 females with genuine stress incontinence (GSI).
 Measurements were performed at the bladder neck, midurethrally and distally in the urethra.
 A statistically significant decrease in power generation was found at the bladder neck and midurethrally during squeezing compared with the values in healthy females.
 During coughing the power generation was significantly decreased midurethrally and measurement of pressure generation revealed similar results.
 These findings indicate that the active closure mechanisms at the bladder neck and midurethra are significantly weakened in females with GSI.
 The results do not support the concept that impaired passive pressure transmission to the urethra is an important pathophysiological factor in GSI.

"Differences in access to zidovudine (AZT) among symptomatic HIV-infected persons.
 OBJECT: To evaluate socioeconomic factors that determine whether symptomatic HIV-infected persons are offered zidovudine (AZT).
 DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted as part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program.
 SETTING: Public hospital clinics and community-based AIDS organizations in nine American cities.
 PATIENTS: 880 HIV-seropositive outpatients interviewed between October 1988 and May 1989.
 MAIN RESULTS: Males were more likely to have been offered AZT than were females (adjusted odds ratio 2.99; 95% confidence interval 1.67 to 5.36), those with insurance were more likely to have been offered AZT than were those without (adjusted odds ratio 2.00; 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 3.21), and whites more likely to have been offered AZT than were non-whites (adjusted odds ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.69).
 Intravenous drug users were less likely to have been offered AZT than were non-drug users (adjusted odds ratio 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.69).
 Persons who had had an episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were more likely to have been offered AZT than were persons who had AIDS and had not had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio 2.95; 95% confidence interval 1.71 to 5.11).
 CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that traditionally disadvantaged groups have less access to AZT, the only antiretroviral agent demonstrated to increase survival of patients who have symptomatic HIV infection.

"The gastropulmonary route of infection--fact or fiction?
 Published studies relating to whether medicinal stress-bleeding prophylaxis leading to an increase of gastric pH favors the development of bronchopulmonary infections are reviewed.
 Results from studies in healthy humans, patients with ulcer disease, and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) clearly show that the risk of gastric bacterial colonization significantly increases relative to increasing gastric pH.
 Moreover, a drug-induced increase of gastric pH leads directly to gastric bacterial colonization also in patients in the ICU, above all with bacteria typical of the gastrointestinal tract.
 Comparing the different bacterial spectra of the oropharynx, stomach, and upper small intestine, it becomes clear that the stomach is a reservoir of bacteria independent of the oropharynx and also subject to retrograde colonization due to the duodenogastric reflux.
 Both by means of microbiological and in particular direct detection procedures, it can be demonstrated that in at least 30-40% of intubated patients a gastropulmonary route of colonization occurs.
 In patient groups without a medication-induced increase of gastric pH the number of bacteria detected in the tracheal secretion is about 33% less than in the case of conventional stress-bleeding prophylaxis.
 These findings make it understandable that a highly significant increase in the pneumonia rate is seen in patients receiving pH-increasing stress-bleeding prophylaxis versus control groups without therapy essentially influencing gastric pH.
 A risk score was developed that allows an easy description of those patients who are at an increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the gastropulmonary route of colonization.

"Low-dose intermittent trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 The important role of chemoprophylaxis for the prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-infected patients is undisputed.
 The most cost-effective regimen, however, is unknown.
 We reviewed our experience at two hospitals in the New York City area in which low-dose, intermittent therapy with the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole was used to prevent PCP in HIV-infected patients.
 During a total of 202 months of primary prophylaxis in 32 patients and 319 months of secondary prophylaxis in 35 patients, PCP was diagnosed only once.
 More than 80% of patients were receiving zidovudine concomitantly.
 Adverse reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole occurred in 31% and 52% of those receiving primary or secondary prophylaxis, respectively.
 When those patients who were considered ineligible to receive trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (principally based on a prior adverse drug reaction) are also factored in, then approximately 50% of HIV-infected patients are candidates for long-term trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis.
 The projected cost savings of this prophylaxis regimen, compared with those currently recommended by the US Public Health Service, are enormous.

"Assessment of diffuse infiltrative lung disease: comparison of conventional CT and high-resolution CT.
 The diagnostic accuracies of conventional computed tomography (CT) and high-resolution CT (HRCT) in examination of the entire lungs were compared prospectively, and the diagnostic utility of a limited number of HRCT sections in the evaluation of diffuse infiltrative lung disease (DILD) was determined in 150 consecutive patients.
 Conventional 10-mm CT sections were equivalent to 1.2-mm HRCT sections in the recognition of nodules, masses, nodular irregularities of the interfaces, large cystic air spaces, and architectural distortion.
 Conventional CT was superior to HRCT in the diagnosis of micronodules and infiltrates.
 However, 15% of micronodules were recognized only on HRCT images because of their small size and low density.
 Fine bronchial and parenchymal lesions were best seen on HRCT scans.
 HRCT was the only technique that allowed assessment of the presence of areas of ground-glass attenuation.
 HRCT improves visualization of small parenchymal structures and allows a confident evaluation of DILD, providing that the entire lungs are studied.
 Nevertheless, an optimal CT evaluation of micronodular patterns requires additional thick-section CT scans.

"Perioperative blood transfusion adversely affects prognosis of patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.
 It has been speculated that blood transfusion might adversely affect prognosis in cancer patients by immunosuppression.
 To avoid the confounding affect of advanced disease, we tested this hypothesis in 117 patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.
 Mean and median follow-up were 49.7 months and 47 months, respectively.
 Patients who died during the postoperative period were not included.
 Perioperative transfusion was defined as administration of whole blood or packed cells within 30 days of operation.
 The overall cumulative 5-year disease-free survival rate was 67%.
 In patients with transfusion, it was 53% and in patients without transfusion it was 81% (p = 0.0055).
 A multivariate analysis was performed that included patient age, race, sex, cell type, extent of operation (pneumonectomy versus lobectomy/segmentectomy), operative blood loss, admission hematocrit, discharge hematocrit, and the presence or absence of perioperative transfusion.
 The only variable that significantly correlated with 5-year disease-free survival was the presence or absence of perioperative transfusion (p = 0.0278), and this effect was not related to the number of transfusions.
 Retrospective analysis of long-term results of patients surviving curative operation for stage I lung cancer shows that any perioperative transfusion significantly worsens the patient's prognosis and suggests very strongly that this association is due to an adverse effect of the transfusion rather than the transfusion serving as a marker for another risk factor.

 Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug with predominantly class III effects, has demonstrated serious adverse drug reactions and interactions.
 The Departments of Pharmacy and Cardiology retrospectively evaluated the monitoring parameters at this institution.
 Criteria based on current literature were developed.
 Twenty-six patients were administered amiodarone, qualifying for entry into the audit.
 Of these patients, seven were excluded because their medical records were unavailable or incomplete.
 The 19 eligible patients were hospitalized during initiation of therapy and followed in the Outpatient Cardiology Clinic.
 The collected data extracted from the medical charts were compared with the following elements of the criteria selected: baseline evaluation prior to the start of therapy; monitoring for signs of pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, cardiac, ophthalmologic, neurologic, and dermatologic toxicity; and evaluation of potential drug interactions with digoxin and warfarin-type anticoagulants.
 The percentage of criteria elements appropriately monitored on each patient ranged from 82 to 100 percent, with an average of 91 percent.
 The most frequently overlooked parameters were warning the patient of a possible photosensitivity reaction, decreasing the digoxin dose if the patient was concurrently taking amiodarone, and performing a slit-lamp examination every six months.

"Dextran sulfate inhibits PMN-dependent hydrostatic pulmonary edema induced by tumor necrosis factor.
 We tested the hypothesis that neutrophil sequestration is required for the development of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) induced neutrophil- (PMN) dependent pulmonary edema.
 TNF (3.2 X 10(5) U/kg ip) was injected into guinea pigs 18 h before lung isolation.
 After isolation, the lung was perfused with a phosphate-buffered Ringer solution.
 Dextran sulfate (mol wt 500,000) prevented the changes in pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc; 8.5 +/- 0.8 vs.
 12.8 +/- 0.8 cmH2O), lung weight gain (dW; +0.240 +/- 0.135 vs.
 +1.951 +/- 0.311 g), and pulmonary edema formation or wet-to-dry wt ratio [(W - D)/D; 6.6 +/- 0.2 vs.
 8.3 +/- 0.5] at 60 min induced by PMN infusion into a TNF-pretreated lung.
 The unsulfated form of dextran had no protective effect [Ppc, dW, and (W - D)/D at 60 min: 11.9 +/- 0.9 cmH2O, +1.650 +/- 0.255 g, and 7.3 +/- 0.2, respectively], whereas the use of another anionic compound, heparin, inhibited the TNF + PMN response [Ppc, dW, and (W - D)/D at 60 min: 5.6 +/- 0.4 cmH2O, +0.168 +/- 0.0.052 g, and 6.4 +/- 0.2, respectively].
 Isolated lungs showed increased PMN myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity compared with control in TNF-treated lungs at baseline and 60 min after PMN infusion.
 Dextran sulfate, dextran, and heparin inhibited the increase in MPO activity.
 The data indicate that inhibition of PMN sequestration alone is not sufficient for the inhibition of PMN-mediated TNF-induced hydrostatic pulmonary edema and that a charge-dependent mechanism mediates the protective effect of dextran sulfate.

"Effect of dexamethasone on pulmonary inflammation and pulmonary function of ventilator-dependent infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 Seventeen ventilator-dependent premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the effects of 3 days of intravenously administered dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg/day) on pulmonary function, pulmonary inflammation, and the requirement for respiratory support (FIO2, ventilator peak pressure [PP], and respiratory rate [RR]).
 Assessment of pulmonary function included measurement of FVC, flow at 25% vital capacity (V25), and static compliance of the respiratory system (Crs), whereas pulmonary inflammation was assessed by the neutrophil count, ratio of elastase/2 x alpha-1-antitrypsin, and the concentrations of albumin and fibronectin in the tracheobronchial lavage (TBL) fluid.
 After 3 days of placebo treatment there were no significant changes in any of the measured parameters.
 In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated group demonstrated a significant decrease in respiratory support (FIO2: 50 versus 36%; PP: 21 versus 16 cm H2O; RR: 22 versus 14 breaths/min) and improved pulmonary function (Crs: 0.63 versus 0.85 ml/cm H2O/kg; V25: 23 versus 68 ml/s/kg).
 In addition, pulmonary inflammation was suppressed in the dexamethasone-treated group (neutrophils: 23 versus 11 x 10(4)/mg albumin: elastase/2 x alpha-1-antitrypsin: 0.24 versus 0.10; albumin: 7.1 versus 3.5 mg/dl; fibronectin: 33 versus 17 micrograms/mg albumin).

"Developing a dysphagia program in an acute care hospital: a needs assessment.
 A needs assessment for a hospital-based dysphagia program was conducted to determine incidence, management procedures, and outcome for stroke patients with swallowing disorders.
 Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia.
 When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods.
 The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate.
 Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased.
 Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care.
 At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care.
 The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems.
 We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital.

"Let's stop the comeback of tuberculosis. Best drug regimens for prevention and treatment.
 Tuberculosis has been on the increase in recent years, so physicians need to be aware of it once again.
 Very effective drugs are available to treat the disease.
 Pharmacokinetics, dosing schedule, and adverse reactions of each anti-tuberculous agent need to be considered.
 A short (6-month) course of therapy is now recommended: Isoniazid, rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), and pyrazinamide are given for the initial 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months.
 If drug resistance is a factor, a fourth drug is added to the initial regimen, and therapy may have to be extended.
 Chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid is very important to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis.
 It should be given to all high-risk persons.

"Differential activation of mixed venous and arterial neutrophils in patients with sepsis syndrome and acute lung injury.
 Neutrophil (PMN) functions, such as production of toxic oxygen (O2) metabolites, adherence, and chemotactic properties, are modified during local tissue inflammation and sepsis.
 We hypothesized that PMN would be primed during their transit through injured tissue beds, which in turn can lead to modulation or retention of the primed PMN by downstream tissues like the lungs.
 We tested this hypothesis by measuring the transpulmonary gradient of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production by zymosan-activated PMN.
 We examined the mixed venous to arterial difference in H2O2(delta H2O2) produced by zymosan-activated PMN in septic patients without lung infiltrates, patients with lung injury, and a control group of patients undergoing elective surgery or coronary catheterization.
 Septic patients had higher mixed venous H2O2/10(6) PMN, whereas lung injury patients had higher arterial H2O2/10(6) PMN.
 The control group had the same H2O2/10(6) PMN in mixed venous and arterial blood.
 The delta H2O2 in septic, lung injury, and control groups were 0.35 +/- 0.22, -0.31 +/- 0.48, and -0.01 +/- 0.04 nmol H2O2/10(6) PMN, respectively.
 The mixed venous to arterial H2O2 gradient distinguished septic patients from the control and lung injury patients (p less than 0.05).
 Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that in septic patients PMN are primed in the periphery and downregulated or sequestered in the lung, and in lung injury patients PMN are primed in the lung and sequestered in the periphery.
 Alternatively, neutrophil-endothelial interactions may downregulate toxic O2 metabolite production by PMN during their transit through microvascular beds.

"Clostridial bacteremia in cancer patients. A 12-year experience.
 Over 12 years, 136 episodes of bacteremia caused by clostridial species were documented.
 Eighty-three were monomicrobial, and 53 were polymicrobial.
 Gastrointestinal, genitourinary carcinomas, and acute leukemia were the most common underlying malignancies.
 Septic shock occurred in 29% of monomicrobial bacteremias and 45% of polymicrobial bacteremias and was associated with a high mortality rate.
 Acute hemolysis, gas gangrene, and diffuse spreading cellulitis occurred infrequently but were associated with a 100% fatality rate.
 Many infections caused by Clostridium perfringens and C.
 septicum were associated with abdominal disease.
 The most commonly isolated organism was C.
 perfringens, followed by C.
 septicum and C.
 sporogenes.
 Overall survival was 58%, but it was 66% for monomicrobial episodes and 45% for polymicrobial infections.
 All of the patients with bacteremia due to an aerobic gram-negative bacillus in addition to the clostridial species died of their infection.
 The most effective antibiotics were clindamycin, penicillin, metronidazole, and moxalactam.

"Oropharyngeal flora and chest infection after upper abdominal surgery.
 The oropharyngeal flora was determined before and after operation in 127 patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery.
 Swabs of the oropharynx were obtained on the day before operation and on the first, third, and fifth postoperative days.
 Isolation of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and coliforms was noted.
 In the 108 patients with the full series of throat swabs the incidence of oropharyngeal colonisation by H influenzae was 16% and was unchanged after operation.
 S pneumoniae was present in only 5.6 (six patients) before operation and the incidence fell to 1.9% (two patients).
 There was a transient rise in coliform colonisation postoperatively.
 Twenty four patients developed a chest infection.
 In eight a bacterial cause was established, in six H influenzae and in two S pneumoniae.
 There was a significant relation between the carriage of H influenzae before operation and development of a chest infection.
 H influenzae was also found more often in cigarette smokers.
 The presence of S pneumoniae or coliform organisms before surgery was not related to the development of infection.
 The high incidence of postoperative chest infection in cigarette smokers appears to be due in part to preoperative colonisation of the oropharynx by H influenzae.

"Posterior cricoarytenoid activity in normal adults during involuntary and voluntary hyperventilation.
 The effect of isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia on the electrical activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle was determined in eight normal adult humans by use of standard rebreathing techniques and was compared with PCA activity during voluntary hyperventilation performed under isocapnic and hypocapnic conditions.
 PCA activity was recorded with intramuscular hooked-wire electrodes implanted through a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscope.
 During quiet breathing in all subjects, the PCA was phasically active on inspiration and tonically active throughout the respiratory cycle.
 At comparable increments in respiratory output, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and voluntary hyperventilation appeared to be associated with similar increases in phasic or tonic PCA activity.
 During quiet breathing, the onset of phasic PCA activity usually occurred before inspiratory airflow and extended beyond the start of expiratory airflow.
 The duration of phasic PCA preactivation and postinspiratory phasic PCA activity remained unchanged during progressive hypercapnia and progressive hypoxia.
 The results, in combination with recent findings for vocal cord adductors, suggest that vocal cord position throughout the respiratory cycle during hyperpnea is actively controlled by simultaneously acting and antagonistic intrinsic laryngeal muscles.

"Crackles in patients with fibrosing alveolitis, bronchiectasis, COPD, and heart failure.
 We have studied the crackling lung sounds of ten patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, ten with bronchiectasis, ten with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ten with heart failure by analyzing frequency, waveform, and timing of crackles.
 The upper frequency limit of inspiratory sounds was higher in CFA than in COPD or in HF.
 The period of crackling was shorter in COPD than in CFA or BE.
 Inspiratory crackling terminated significantly earlier in COPD than in CFA, BE, or HF.
 The initial deflection width and the two-cycle duration of the expanded waveforms of crackles were smaller in CFA than in BE, COPD, or HF.
 The largest deflection width was smaller in CFA than in BE, HF, or COPD and smaller in BE than in HF.
 The results indicate that crackling lung sounds in different diseases have distinctive features and that their analysis can be of diagnostic value.

"Impact of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 on tuberculosis in rural Haiti.
 We conducted a case-control study to determine the relative and attributable risk of HIV seropositivity for bacillary-positive (smear and/or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis in Haiti.
 There were 274 patients with tuberculosis and an equal number of control subjects.
 Antibodies to HIV were present in 67 (24%) patients and eight (3%) control subjects.
 Odds ratios suggested that the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis was 15.7 times as great (95% confidence interval, 4.8 to 5.0; p less than 0.05) in patients 20 to 39 yr of age who were HIV-seropositive than in HIV-seronegative patients.
 In contrast, the relative risk in those 40 to 59 yr of age was elevated (3.0 times), though not significantly (lower 95% confidence interval, 0.8).
 In the 20- to 39-yr age group, 31% of tuberculosis was attributable to HIV infection (95% confidence interval between 23 and 39%).
 HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients did not differ with respect to sputum smear positivity.
 HIV-seronegative patients were twice as likely to be infected with resistant organisms, though this was not significant.
 We conclude that HIV infection is a major risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis in young adult residents of Haiti.
 This, together with the fact that similar proportions of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients were potentially infectious, suggests that without vigorous counteraction tuberculosis will become a greater problem for Haiti.

"Serologic evidence of subclinical pertussis in immunized children.
 Incidental to a vaccine study involving 783 immunized children conducted at two study sites, inner city children had significantly higher geometric mean pertussis agglutinin titers compared with suburban children just before the fourth dose of diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis vaccine (47 vs.
 25; P less than 0.001).
 Higher titers in the inner city were correlated with residence in census tracts where cases of pertussis were reported.
 Three hundred thirty-two children in a placebo arm of the study who were clinically observed and had paired serum samples taken during a 2- to 4-month period were analyzed for evidence of natural Bordetella infection.
 Twelve (11%) inner city children and three (1.3%) suburban children had spontaneous 4-fold or greater rises in at least two different pertussis antibodies measured (agglutinin, antitoxin or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG to pertussis toxin, IgG and IgA to filamentous hemagglutinin).
 Eighty percent of these children had IgA to filamentous hemagglutinin.
 Nine of 12 inner city children with serologic evidence of pertussis lived within 6 blocks of a case of pertussis reported within 1 month of the observed antibody rise in study subjects; none had a household member with pertussis and none had symptomatic disease.

 A total of 1,449 nasal swab specimens from 158 children less than 5 years of age who were studied intensively for 18 months were examined.
 Non-serotypable strains of Haemophilus influenzae were isolated from 91% of specimens, and serotypable strains were isolated from 35% (8% H.

 All children had acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae by the age of 3 months.
 The most frequently occurring serotypes of S.

 Children more frequently carried invasive pneumococci during an episode of ALRI than when they were healthy.
 Also, children more frequently carried serotypable strains of H.

"Expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors on alveolar lymphocytes from patients with pulmonary granulomatous diseases.
 1,25(OH)2D3 is known to be produced at sites of granulomatous reactions.
 In order to characterize the cell types that are targets for this immunoregulatory hormone, we have evaluated the expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors on peripheral blood T-lymphocytes and those recovered from the lung by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with pulmonary granulomatous diseases (tuberculosis and sarcoidosis) and from normal control subjects using combined autoradiographic and immunohistochemical techniques.
 Lavage T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis or with sarcoidosis, but not those from normal control subjects, expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors as demonstrated by binding of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3, which was inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled 1,25(OH)2D3, but not by the presence of unlabeled 25(OH)D3 (receptor-positive lymphocytes: sarcoidosis, 20 +/- 12%; tuberculosis, 31 +/- 17%).
 In contrast, blood lymphocytes from patients with granulomatous diseases did not express detectable 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors.
 The percentage of lavage T-lymphocytes expressing 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors was significantly greater for patients with tuberculosis presenting with isolated hilar adenopathy than for patients with pulmonary infiltrates and/or cavities.
 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors were expressed to a greater extent on CD8+ T-lymphocytes than on CD4+ T-lymphocytes in sarcoidosis, whereas a greater proportion of CD4+ than of CD8+ T-lymphocytes from patients with tuberculosis were receptor-positive.
 These findings support the conclusion that the interaction of 1,25(OH)2D3 with its receptor on T-lymphocytes may play an important role in the regulation of granulomatous reactions, but because these receptors are expressed on different lymphocyte populations, the net effect of this potent immunoregulatory molecule is likely different in sarcoidosis and tuberculosis.

"Manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.
 Meningitis is the most frequent manifestation of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans; pneumonia due to this organism, though less frequently recognized, is also a significant entity.
 A retrospective review was performed of all patients seen at Duke University Medical Center between January 1981 and July 1989 who were infected with both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and C.
 neoformans.
 Of 31 patients with these concomitant infections, 12 had cryptococcal pneumonia (10 definite and two presumptive cases).
 Eleven of these 12 patients had evidence of extrapulmonary cryptococcal disease as well.
 Chest radiography showed interstitial infiltrates in 11 instances.
 For ten of the 12 patients, pulmonary cultures were positive for C.

 Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from all five patients who underwent bronchoscopy yielded the organism.
 Acute-phase mortality from cryptococcosis was 42% among patients with pneumonia.
 Cryptococcal pneumonia in patients with AIDS is probably more common than has previously been recognized and typically presents as interstitial disease that may mimic other opportunistic infections.

"Changes in periurethral microflora after antimicrobial drugs.
 The periurethral flora was examined in 18 girls by use of a quantitative sampling method before, during, and three weeks after treatment with antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections.
 Eight girls received amoxicillin.
 In five of them the anaerobic flora showed a reduction in total counts and in numbers of different species, and all eight girls got a heavy colonisation with enterobacteria during treatment.
 Three weeks after treatment the anaerobic and aerobic flora had reversed to the pretreatment composition.
 In 10 girls treated with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole the anaerobic flora remained unaffected and no enterobacterial overgrowth was registered during the study period.
 We propose that antibiotics could be one among several factors involved in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, by suppression of the anaerobic microflora and promotion of the colonisation with enterobacteria.

"Primary and metastatic pulmonary meningioma.
 Patient 1 was a 53-year-old man who had a very rare primary pulmonary meningioma that developed in the left lingular segment.
 When this report was written, 7 years had passed since he underwent operation, and no recurrence of the meningioma had been detected.
 In Patient 2, a 61-year-old woman, multiple pulmonary metastases were confirmed 19 years after she had undergone operation for multiple cerebellar meningiomas, and the metastases were resected.
 After 2 years, multiple intraperitoneal metastases were found, and thus aggressive surgery was performed.
 Currently, 22 years after the operation for the primary cerebellar meningioma, the patient is alive without any subjective symptoms, although intraperitoneal metastases have recurred.
 To date, only four cases (all in women) of primary pulmonary meningioma have been reported.
 Case 1 reported in this article is thus the first case in a male patient to be reported, and, in addition, this patient also has the first reported case to have been evaluated for more than 5 years.
 In Case 2, however, each of the excised extracranial tumor lesions was histologically homogeneous and showed a hemangiopericytomatous pattern.
 The histologic picture of those tumor lesions was exactly the same as the picture of a small portion of the cerebellar meningiomas excised 19 years earlier.
 Thus, all those extracranial tumor lesions were diagnosed to be metastatic meningiomas.
 However, it is difficult to explain why there had been no symptoms for as long as 19 years until the pulmonary metastases were discovered.

 We prospectively evaluated consecutive admissions to a pediatric ICU (PICU) over two time periods totaling 6 months.
 Twenty-five (4.6%) admissions were necessitated by iatrogenic illnesses.
 Drug-induced conditions accounted for eight (32%) of the iatrogenic patients, and complications of medical-surgical acts accounted for 17 (68%).
 Diagnoses included six respiratory failures due to seizure medications, six chronic upper airway complications of neonatal intensive care, four posttonsillectomy and postadenoidectomy complications, two chronic postcardiac surgery complications, two cardiac catheterization complications, and five miscellaneous conditions.

"Comparison of the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on the airway response to histamine, methacholine, hyperventilation, and sulfur dioxide in subjects with asthma.
 To investigate whether inhaled steroids modulate the airway response to different bronchoconstrictive stimuli, we studied 25 subjects with mild asthma with a double-blind, noncrossover design to compare the effect of a 3-week treatment with salbutamol (0.2 mg, four times a day [q.i.d.]) and placebo (N = 11) to the effect of salbutamol (0.2 mg q.i.d.) and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP, 0.5 mg q.i.d.) (N = 14).
 Airway response to histamine and methacholine was assessed as the provocative concentration (in milligrams per milliliter) necessary to increase the specific airway resistance (SRaw) (in centimeters of H2O times second) by 100% (PC100 SRaw).
 Airway response to hyperventilation of air and to hyperventilation of 0.75 ppm of sulfur dioxide (SO2) was determined as the provocative ventilation (in liters per minute) necessary to increase SRaw by 75% (PV75 SRaw).
 Challenges were performed on separate days before and after treatment, and salbutamol inhalation was withheld at least 6 hours before each challenge.
 Salbutamol and placebo did not change perchallenge baseline SRaw nor did they have any significant effect on the airway response to the stimuli.
 Salbutamol and BDP decreased the mean prechallenge baseline SRaw (SEM) from 7.7 (0.37) to 5.9 (0.28) (p less than 0.01) and significantly (p less than 0.01) increased geometric mean (SEM) PC100 SRaw for histamine from 0.5 (1.42) to 0.9 (1.53) mg/ml; for methacholine, from 0.2 (1.47) to 0.5 (1.51) mg/ml; and mean (SEM) PV75 SRaw for hyperventilation of air from 51.8 (2.32) to 58.4 (1.86) L/min.

"The time course of bronchoconstriction in asthmatics during and after isocapnic hyperventilation.
 We studied the effect of changing the duration of isocapnic hyperventilation on the time course of bronchoconstriction in five subjects with asthma.
 Each subject performed hyperventilation challenges of 4, 8, and 16 min.
 No significant bronchoconstriction occurred until the hyperventilation was stopped, regardless of its duration.
 We found increased bronchoconstriction as the duration of hyperventilation increased.
 The declines in FEV1 (mean +/- SD) from baseline were 13 +/- 10%, 22 +/- 7%, and 29 +/- 12% for 4, 8, and 16 min of hyperventilation, respectively (1 versus 3, p less than 0.01).
 Mean times after hyperventilation until maximal bronchoconstriction were 12 +/- 4 min, 9 +/- 6 min, and 6 +/- 4 min.
 We also found slight bronchodilation during the first 4 min of hyperventilation.
 After 2 and 4 min of hyperventilation, the FEV1 was 103 +/- 5% and 103 +/- 3% of baseline, respectively (both p less than 0.05, compared to baseline).
 We conclude that increasing the duration of hyperventilation delays the onset of bronchoconstriction but causes greater bronchoconstriction once the hyperventilation is stopped.
 These results suggest that either hyperventilation itself inhibits bronchoconstriction or that the mechanisms that induce bronchoconstriction in response to hyperventilation operate after, rather than during, hyperventilation.

"Endoscopic repair of supraglottic laryngeal clefts.
 We describe the technique of endoscopic diagnosis and endoscopic surgical repair used in the management of supraglottic interarytenoid laryngeal clefts in 11 children seen between 1981 and 1988 at the Hospital for Sick Children, London, England.
 Six of the children had primary type I clefts that required endoscopic repair.
 The symptoms included inspiratory stridor, choking during eating, and aspiration.
 Five of the children had previous transcervical repair of type II clefts that had partial breakdown in the interarytenoid area causing symptoms of aspiration, which required secondary repair endoscopically.
 All the patients had successful microlaryngoscopic closure; in two children, however, the breakdown of the repair necessitated repeated endoscopic correction.
 The only complication occurred in a case of postoperative supraglottitis, which was successfully managed with intubation and antibiotics.
 We conclude that endoscopic repair is a useful and reliable technique and an elegant alternative to the open transcervical approach for the closure of supraglottic laryngeal clefts.

 Only 1 of 26 synovial-fluid mononuclear cell samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients showed a positive response (stimulation index 3 or more) to 65 kD compared with 5 of 22 pleural-exudate mononuclear cell samples, so 65 kD seems not to be the major antigen recognised by synovial-fluid T cells in rheumatoid arthritis.
 Enhanced reactivity against mycobacterial and other bacterial antigens is not restricted to mononuclear cells from chronically inflamed joints but seems to be a common feature of chronic inflammation.

"Airway response to exercise and methacholine in children with respiratory symptoms.
 Thirty atopic and 30 non-atopic subjects were identified from a population of 7-8 year old children with current respiratory symptoms.
 The response of the airways to exercise and provocation by methacholine were compared.
 In these children, who had symptoms but were not necessarily asthmatic, there was no significant correlation between the two stimuli.
 The atopic children were, however, significantly more responsive than the non-atopic children to both.
 For the whole group, odds ratios derived for atopy and for an increased response to methacholine (expressed as a PD20--the dose that caused the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to fall by 20%--of less than 6.4 mumol/l), a positive exercise test (greater than 15% fall in FEV1), and the presence of asthma were 13.5, 3.3, and 21.0, respectively; that for positive response to methacholine and positive exercise challenge was 1.5.
 Thus though increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and exercise challenge are both associated with a diagnosis of asthma, the association between the two stimuli is complex, and supports the view that they reflect entirely different components of airways dysfunction.

"Prognostic implications of DNA histogram, DNA content, and histologic changes of regional lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer.
 Forty-six cases of resected lung cancer, including 20 cases at Stages I and II and 26 cases at Stage III (N2), were subdivided into two groups: a good prognosis group with a longer survival period and a poor prognosis group in which the patients died earlier of the cancer.
 From paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues of these patients, the authors examined DNA histogram pattern and DNA content, using flow cytometry, and histologic hyperplasia of germinal center and paracortical area; they also evaluated their correlation with the prognosis.
 In the good prognosis group at Stages I and II, paracortical hyperplasia (PH) of the lymph nodes was observed significantly more frequently.
 In the good prognosis group at Stage III, the incidence of PH, G2M phase in the DNA histograms, and DNA content were all significantly higher.
 DNA content was positively correlated with the grade of PH.

"Cost-effectiveness of alpha-1 antitrypsin replacement therapy in treatment of congenital chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
 BACKGROUND: Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) replacement therapy is an expensive intervention ($20,000-$30,000 per patient annually) which may slow or arrest the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in AAT-deficient patients.
 While FDA-approved, therapy efficacy is unknown.
 The costs and benefits of AAT replacement therapy were evaluated for patients with congenital COPD.
 METHODS: Epidemiological and disease cost data were taken from published sources.
 A discrete-time model of disease stage probability transition was developed to calculate the present-value expected cost of disease treatment, under a range of possible therapy efficacy and other parameter values.
 RESULTS: At an efficacy of 70 percent, the cost per life year saved with AAT replacement therapy would be between $28,000 and $72,000 (1990 US dollars), depending on patient age, sex, and smoking status.
 At 30 percent efficacy, the cost per life year saved range would be between $50,000 and $128,000.
 A controlled efficacy study would cost $53 million or less, if the true efficacy were 50 percent or better.
 CONCLUSIONS: With efficacy of 30 percent or higher, therapy cost-effectiveness would be comparable to other widely used medical interventions.
 The economic assessment methodology was used to evaluate both the therapeutic innovation and the value of additional clinical research.

"Child care practices with respect to acute respiratory tract infection in a poor, urban community in Nigeria.
 A longitudinal study conducted over a 3-year period in a poor, urban community in Nigeria, a developing country, found that acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was common, in particular among infants and boys.
 Between 81% and 95% of the children treated for ARI over the 3-year period were brought to the clinic by their mothers.
 About 32% of these children had been treated with cough medicines, 42% with antipyretics, 5% with antibiotics, and 10% with hematinics before they were brought to the clinic.
 The source of such medications included medicines left over from previous prescriptions and those bought from chemists' shops and street vendors.
 Up to 64% of the children treated for ARI had been force-fed local herbal teas by their mothers; herbal teas were used for both preventive and curative purposes.

"Vitronectin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is increased in patients with interstitial lung disease.
 Vitronectin, also known as S-protein, is a 75,000-dalton serum glycoprotein that has a variety of functions, including the capacity to interact with the terminal components of the complement cascade, the coagulation system, and cell surfaces.
 By virtue of its ability to interact with cells, vitronectin is capable of mediating cell-spreading and adhesion and may also influence cell differentiation and cell growth.
 To investigate the possibility that vitronectin might contribute to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease, vitronectin was measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and, for comparison, normal volunteers.
 Vitronectin was detected in lavage fluid and serum of all study subjects.
 Increased lavage fluid concentrations were found in patients with interstitial lung disease when compared with normal subjects (p less than 0.005), and glucocorticoid-treated patients with interstitial lung disease had lower vitronectin levels than did untreated patients.
 Furthermore, on SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis lavage fluid vitronectin comigrated with serum vitronectin, suggesting similar molecular size.
 Thus, vitronectin is a normal constituent of the epithelial lining fluid, and lavage fluid vitronectin is similar to serum vitronectin.
 The increase of vitronectin concentrations in the epithelial lining fluid of patients with interstitial lung disease suggests that vitronectin may contribute to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease.

"Factors determining pulmonary deposition of aerosolized pentamidine in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Although aerosolized pentamidine (AP) has recently been approved for prophylaxis and is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of pneumocystis, pneumonia (PCP), factors important in the deposition of AP have not been described.
 Using radioaerosol techniques, deposition was measured in 22 patients receiving AP for prophylaxis or treatment of PCP.
 In all patients total and regional deposition of pentamidine, breathing pattern, pulmonary function (PFT), regional ventilation, and type of nebulizer were analyzed.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24 h after inhalation to assess the relationship between pentamidine levels in BAL fluid and measured aerosol deposition.
 The nebulizers tested were the Marquest Respirgard II and the Cadema AeroTech II, both previously characterized in our laboratory.
 The aerosol particles consist of water droplets containing dissolved pentamidine and technetium 99m bound to albumin.
 Analysis of particles sampled during inhalation via cascade impaction confirmed a close relationship between radioactivity in the droplets and the concentration of pentamidine as measured by HPLC (r = 0.971, p less than 0.0001; n = 18).
 Deposition was measured by capturing inhaled and exhaled particles on absolute filters and measuring radioactivity.
 This technique allows the determination of the deposition fraction (DF, the fraction of the amount inhaled that is deposited), which provides information on factors strictly related to the patient.
 To confirm the filter measurements, pentamidine deposition was also measured by gamma camera.
 The camera measurement was possible because each patient's thoracic attenuation of radioactivity was determined by a quantitative perfusion scan (mg pentamidine deposited via both techniques, r = 0.949, p less than 0.0001; n = 26).
 Regional lung volume and ventilation were determined by xenon 133 equilibrium scan and washout.
 Pentamidine deposition varied markedly between patients, but BAL levels of pentamidine significantly correlated with measured deposition (r = 0.819, p less than 0.01; n = 9).
 DF averaged 0.621 +/- 0.027 (SEM) and did not correlate with any measured lung parameter, including breathing pattern and PFT.
 Regional deposition did not correlate with regional ventilation.
 The major factor influencing pentamidine deposition was aerosol delivery (mg deposited versus mg inhaled; r = 0.963, p less than 0.0001; n = 26).
 The nebulizer was an important determinant of aerosol delivery, with the AeroTech delivering between 2.5 and 5 times more drug than the Respirgard.
 These observations are important in assessing treatment failure and cost of therapy.

"Reoperative pulmonary resection in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma 
 Resection of pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma has been shown to be associated with a 3-year survival of 25% to 30%.
 The role of multiple resections for recurrent pulmonary metastases, however, has not been clearly defined.
 Since 1976, 43 patients have had two or more thoracic explorations for the purpose of resecting pulmonary metastases from adult soft tissue sarcoma at our institution.
 In 89 reexplorations, through either median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy, the operative mortality was 0%, and 31 of the 43 patients (72%) could be rendered free of disease at the second thoracotomy.
 Median survival from the second thoracotomy for the patients with resectable disease was 25 months, whereas median survival of patients who had unresectable disease was 10 months.
 A disease-free interval between the first and second thoracotomies of greater than 18 months was associated with prolonged survival from the second thoracotomy.
 Owing to lack of other therapies with proven salvage efficacy and in the absence of randomized trials, repeated thoracotomies to render patients free of disease from pulmonary soft-tissue sarcoma metastases appear justified considering the potential survival benefit and low attendant risk.

"Screening for lung cancer. A critique of the Mayo Lung Project.
 The National Cancer Institute of the United States recently sponsored three large-scale, randomized controlled trials of screening for early lung cancer.
 The trials were conducted at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Mayo Clinic.
 Participants were middle-aged and older men who were chronic heavy cigarette smokers and thus at high risk of developing lung cancer.
 Screening procedures were chest radiography and sputum cytology, the only screening tests of established value for detecting early stage, asymptomatic lung cancer.
 In the Hopkins and Memorial trials the study population was offered yearly chest radiography plus sputum cytology every 4 months.
 The control population was offered yearly chest radiography only.
 In these trials the addition of sputum cytology appeared to confer no lung cancer mortality rate advantage.
 The Mayo Clinic trial compared offering chest radiography and sputum cytology every 4 months to offering advice that the two tests be obtained once a year.
 This trial demonstrated significantly increased lung cancer detection, resectability, and survivorship in the group offered screening every 4 months compared with the control group.
 However, there was no significant difference in lung cancer mortality rate between the two groups.
 The statistical power of these trials was somewhat limited.
 Nevertheless, results do not justify recommending large-scale radiologic or cytologic screening for early lung cancer at this time.

"Acute illness in maple syrup urine disease: dynamics of protein metabolism and implications for management.
 Acute metabolic decompensation in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) during otherwise minor illnesses has generally been presumed to result from massive release of leucine from protein catabolism.
 A stable isotope method based on the continuous infusion of (2H5)phenylalanine was used to measure protein metabolism in vivo in two children with MSUD during acute illness and when well.
 Net protein catabolism was greater in the unwell state (0.51 and 0.40 gm/kg per 24 hours in each child, respectively) than in the basal state (0.34 and 0.32).
 This rate of release of leucine from protein is compatible only with a slow (several days) rather than a dramatic rise in plasma leucine levels during acute illness in MSUD.
 Poor oral intake leading to a relative increase in time spent in the fasting state appears to be a more important determinant of increasing leucine levels than the catabolic effect of infection in itself.
 These factors suggested that branched-chain amino acid restriction should be commenced at the start of minor illness in children with MSUD, and that intake of other nutrients should be maintained or increased throughout the illness.
 A regimen based on these concepts was used during nine episodes of minor illness in two children with MSUD.
 Plasma branched-chain amino acid levels remained acceptable (less than 700 mumol/L) throughout each of these episodes.
 Dietary supplementation of this type may reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation during acute illnesses in children with MSUD.

"Does the substitution of cisplatin in a standard four drug regimen improve survival in small cell carcinoma of the lung? A comparison of two chemotherapy regimens.
 Ninety five patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung were randomly assigned to one of two chemotherapy regimens (VACE or CVACE), each consisting of six cycles at three week intervals.
 The VACE regimen consisted of six cycles of vincristine 1.2 mg/m2, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 700 mg/m2 on day 1 plus etoposide 110 mg/m2 daily for three days.
 The CVACE regimen was identical to the VACE regimen for cycles 3 and 4; cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 consisted of etoposide 110 mg/m2 for three days plus cisplatin 100 mg/m2 with mannitol diuresis on the second day.
 Forty eight patients received VACE and 47 CVACE.
 Side effects resulted in withdrawal of four patients receiving VACE and six receiving CVACE.
 Three deaths were attributed to VACE and one to CVACE.
 Median survival did not differ between the two treatments overall, though there was a small increase in median survival in partial responders receiving CVACE.
 It is concluded that replacing four of the six cycles of VACE (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide) with etoposide and cisplatin conferred no overall advantage.

"Acid-base derangements during sorbent regenerative hemodialysis in mechanically ventilated patients.
 OBJECTIVE: To assess acid-base derangements during sorbent regenerative hemodialysis in mechanically ventilated patients.
 DESIGN: Consecutive case series; prospective study.
 SETTING: An ICU in a university hospital.
 PATIENTS: Seven patients undergoing hemodialysis for acute renal failure who required mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure.
 INTERVENTIONS: Pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics, pH, and gas tensions in dialysate, arterial and mixed venous blood, and blood entering and leaving the dialyzer, were measured before, during, and after hemodialysis.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the first 2 hrs of hemodialysis, dialysate pH decreased from 6.91 +/- 0.14 to 6.06 +/- 0.37 and PCO2 increased to 437 +/- 111 torr (58.2 +/- 14.8 kPa).
 Simultaneously, the patients lost bicarbonate into the bath.
 As a result, pHa decreased from 7.38 +/- 0.02 to 7.31 +/- 0.02.
 At the end of dialysis, pHa returned to normal.
 CONCLUSION: Sorbent hemodialysis in mechanically ventilated patients is accompanied by acidosis that may contribute to hemodynamic instability.

"Reduced allergen-induced nasal congestion and leukotriene synthesis with an orally active 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor 
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS.
 The clinical importance of leukotrienes in human allergy has not been defined, in part because there have been no selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors that have been effective and safe for use in humans.
 To address the hypothesis that stimulated leukotriene synthesis causes symptoms of immediate-hypersensitivity reactions in vivo, I investigated the effects of a new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-64077, on provoked allergic nasal symptoms and mediator release in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
 Eight subjects with allergic rhinitis underwent nasal challenge on two occasions after an oral dose of 800 mg of A-64077 or an identical-appearing placebo.
 RESULTS.
 Allergen-induced nasal congestion was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.02) by A-64077; peak levels of leukotriene B4 (median, 684 pg per milliliter) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (median, 704 pg per milliliter) in nasal-rinse fluids were markedly reduced (to 67 and 185 pg per milliliter, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas levels of prostaglandin D2 were not.
 Histamine release and sneezing were not reduced significantly by A-64077, but there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between the changes in these variables within subjects.
 The mean (+/- SEM) stimulated synthesis of leukotriene B4 in whole blood ex vivo was markedly reduced by A-64077 (from 153 +/- 19 to 20 +/- 9 ng per milliliter, P less than 0.01), and the specificity of A-64077 for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition was verified by its lack of effect on the synthesis of serum thromboxane B2 or 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 These results provide direct evidence of an important role for the 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid in allergic rhinitis and support the notion that further experiments in this area may lead to new therapeutic approaches to allergic disorders.

"Immunohistologic evaluation of parathyroid hormone-related protein in human lung cancer and normal tissue with newly developed monoclonal antibody.
 With a newly developed monoclonal anti-PTHrP antibody, 4B3, the immunohistochemical localization of the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was studied on the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of normal human tissues and various subtypes of lung cancer.
 Among normal epithelial tissues, keratinocytes in squamous epithelia, transitional and bronchial epithelia with squamous metaplasia, meningoepithelial cells, and mammary ductal cells with lactating changes showed positive immunoreactivity.
 Also, among endocrine tissues, cells in the parathyroid gland, pancreatic islets, adrenal cortex, pituitary gland, and testis were sporadically positive for PTHrP.
 These distribution patterns suggested that in a physiologic condition, PTHrP was closely related to keratinization and local secretion and/or the metabolism of calcium in specifically differentiated tissues.
 In lung cancer, however, PTHrP was detected in all cases of well-differentiated and moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in most cases of small cell carcinoma, irrespective of the patients' serum calcium level.
 However, PTHrP was not detected in two of five cases of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in all cases of adenocarcinoma.
 Consequently, it was found that PTHrP was commonly produced by squamous cell carcinomas of the differentiated type, and that humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy could be induced when the PTHrP transgressed the homeostatic mechanisms.

"Emergency tracheal intubation in the postanesthesia care unit: physician error or patient disease?
 Inadequate airway maintenance has been a major factor in perioperative morbidity.
 To determine the incidence and etiology of emergency tracheal intubations in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), we retrospectively reviewed 13,593 consecutive admissions to our PACU from October 1986 through October 1988.
 Twenty-six patients (26/13,593 = 0.19%) required the insertion of an endotracheal tube while in the PACU.
 Seventy-seven percent (20/26) of the intubations occurred within 1 h of extubation and/or admission to the PACU.
 Intubation was more common at the extremes of age; 54% of those intubated were more than 60 yr old (P = 0.003); 19% were less than 3 yr old (P less than 0.05).
 Twenty-three percent of the intubated patients had undergone otolaryngologic procedures (P = 0.008).
 Interestingly, 73% of the intubations occurred during the months of January through June (P = 0.016).
 Median PACU admission scores were lower for the intubated group (P less than 0.001).
 There was no association between intubation and gender (P = 0.74), anesthetic technique (P = 0.41), or anesthetic agent (P = 0.49).
 Of the 26 intubations, 18 (69%) were considered to be directly related to anesthetic management.
 Despite the extremely low incidence of emergency tracheal intubation in a heterogeneous group of patients admitted to our PACU, preventable anesthesia-related etiologic factors including excessive sedative or anesthetic effect, inappropriate fluid management, persistent muscle relaxant effect, and upper airway obstruction contributed to the majority of these intubations.

"Hypercarbic acidosis reduces cardiac resuscitability.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Marked increases in myocardial hypercarbia and acidosis accompany cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
 To investigate whether hypercarbic acidosis independent of oxygenation is of itself detrimental to cardiac resuscitation, three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with gas mixtures containing concentrations of inspired CO2 (FICO2) of 0.0, 0.3, or 0.5, with oxygen fractions held constant at 0.5.
 After 4 mins of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical chest compressions were initiated with a pneumatic thumper; 2 mins later, transthoracic defibrillation was attempted.
 RESULTS: Each animal ventilated with FICO2 of 0.0 or 0.3 was successfully resuscitated.
 However, none of the animals ventilated with FICO2 of 0.5, in which aortic pH was less than 6.67 and aortic PCO2 was greater than 200 torr (greater than 26.7 kPa), was resuscitated (p less than .001).
 This finding contrasted with a second control group of seven identically treated animals which, in the absence of cardiac arrest, demonstrated no adverse effects after ventilation with an FICO2 of 0.5.
 CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FICO2 to levels of 0.5 under conditions of constant arterial oxygenation and controlled coronary perfusion pressure preclude successful resuscitation in this rodent model of CPR.

"Effect of atopy on the natural history of symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and bronchial responsiveness in 7- and 8-year-old children with cough and wheeze. A 12-month longitudinal study.
 Recurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms are common and disabling in childhood, but little is known of their natural history and relationship to asthma.
 We report a 12-month longitudinal study designed to determine the influence of atopy on respiratory symptoms and bronchial responsiveness in 7- and 8-yr-old children.
 A postal questionnaire inquiring into the presence of respiratory symptoms was sent to 3,698 children aged 7 and 8 yr.
 Those reporting either current wheeze (14.8%) or current cough in the absence of wheeze (12.8%) were randomized, and a sample was invited to attend for skin testing.
 The following groups of symptomatic children entered the longitudinal study: 48 atopic children with cough, 48 atopic children with wheeze, 48 nonatopic children with cough, and 48 nonatopic children with wheeze.
 All children recorded twice daily the best of three peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and completed a 10-point symptom score card, each day for 1 yr.
 They also recorded all treatment taken and made a note of relevant life events.
 Each child was seen monthly for general assessment and for measurement of methacholine bronchial responsiveness.
 Despite the arduous nature of the study 183 of the 192 children (95.3%) successfully completed the 12 months of observation.
 Symptom groups were compared with regard to FEV1, bronchial responsiveness, symptom chronicity and severity, and diurnal and day-to-day variation in PEF.
 Atopy was associated with a lower FEV1, increased prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, greater within-day and between-day variation in PEF, and greater severity of respiratory symptoms compared with the absence of atopy.

 It is anticipated that with a larger database, the ability to aspirate blood simultaneously during the dissecting process will result in a significant shortening of circulatory arrest time.

"A randomized controlled evaluation of a psychosocial intervention in adults with chronic lung disease.
 The effect of a stress management program on morbidity and psychosocial and physical function in patients with chronic lung disease was assessed.
 Adults attending either a VA pulmonary clinic or university hospital pulmonary rehabilitation clinic who met criteria for obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease were randomly assigned to receive the intervention or to a control group.
 The intervention was provided by a nurse and included one to three teaching sessions, reading material, audiotapes, and telephone follow-up.
 The program focused on stress management techniques such as cognitive restructuring, progressive relaxation, breathing exercises, and visual imagery.
 The 45 experimental subjects were similar to the 49 controls with respect to baseline characteristics.
 Experimental and control subjects had similar rates of mortality, hospital days, bed-disability days, restricted-activity days, and physician visits during the 12-month follow-up.
 There were no differences between the two groups in physical or psychosocial function at six months or in levels of stressful life changes, social supports, and self-esteem at six and 12 months.
 Intervention recipients had better function at 12 months, suggesting a possible benefit of the intervention.

"Site of upper airway obstruction in preterm infants with problematical apnoea.
 Airway obstruction is an important factor predisposing to the development of apnoea in preterm infants.
 An ultrafine fibreoptic scope was used to examine the upper airway of 12 preterm infants with recurrent problematical apnoea.
 Continuous visualisation of the airway was possible and recorded on to videotape together with simultaneous cardiorespiratory monitoring to detect apnoeic episodes in 12 infants studied.
 In seven infants obstruction was observed at laryngeal level with the arytenoid masses and aryepiglottic folds closing across the vocal cords.
 This was not only observed in obstructive apnoea but also during mixed apnoea in periods where no respiratory effort was detectable and again in apparently pure central apnoea.
 The findings confirm the larynx as an anatomical site of upper airway obstruction.
 They agree with other indirect methods of assessing airway patency that obstruction has an important role in the pathophysiology of apnoea of prematurity.

"Clinical spectrum of bronchogenic cysts of the mediastinum and lung in the adult.
 Bronchogenic cysts are closed sacs considered to be the result of an abnormal budding of the respiratory system.
 They are lined by ciliated epithelium and have focal areas of hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial glands within their walls.
 They are seldom seen in the adult, and most are thought to be asymptomatic and free of complications.
 During a 20-year period, 86 patients underwent resection of a bronchogenic cyst of the mediastinum (66 patients) and lung (20 patients).
 There were 47 women and 39 men whose ages ranged from 16 to 69 years.
 Seventy-two percent of patients (67% with mediastinal cysts and 90% with cysts of the lung) were symptomatic at the time of operation, and the majority had two or more symptoms.
 Despite extensive investigations, which in some cases included computed tomographic scanning (n = 12) and angiography (n = 22), a positive diagnosis was never made preoperatively even if it was suspected in 57% of patients.
 In nearly all patients, the operative approach was that of a posterolateral thoracotomy.
 All but two mediastinal bronchogenic cysts could be locally excised, but all bronchogenic cysts of the lung required pulmonary resection (lobectomy, 13; limited resection, 6; pneumonectomy, 1).
 Major operative difficulties were encountered in 35 patients, all of whom were symptomatic preoperatively.
 Thirty-three patients had a complicated cyst; the complications consisted of fistulization (n = 16), ulcerations of the cyst wall (n = 13), hemorrhage (n = 2), infection without fistulization (n = 1), and secondary bronchial atresia (n = 1).
 Overall, 82% of patients had a bronchogenic cyst that was either symptomatic or complicated or both.

"Pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries. A prospective study of 12 cases.
 Pulmonary tumor embolism leading to subacute cor pulmonale has been extensively studied.
 However, to our knowledge, the involvement of pulmonary alveolar capillaries has not previously been studied in detail.
 A prospective study was conducted on 112 autopsied patients with cancer to determine the presence of microembolism in the alveolar septal capillaries.
 Fifteen sections of predetermined lung areas were obtained and examined.
 Tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries was detected in 12 cases (10.7%), with simultaneous involvement of other vascular territories in 11.
 Seven patients had dyspnea; four, right ventricular failure; four, hypertrophy of the right ventricle; and three, arterial vascular sclerosis.
 The present data have led us to conclude that pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries occurs in association with the involvement of arterial or lymphatic vessels and should be analyzed within the context of the study of subacute cor pulmonale.

 Thirteen of the remaining 21 patients had ventricular tachycardia on subsequent analysis of the electrocardiogram.
 These arrhythmias subsided after induction of anesthesia when blood pressure control was optimal.

 One hundred sixty-five patients were randomized to receive either interferon alfa-n1 (Wellferon; Burroughs Wellcome Co, Research Triangle Park, NC) alone or with vinblastine.
 An initial six-cycle induction treatment consisted of interferon given at daily doses of 3, 5, 20, 20, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2 every 2 weeks.
 Vinblastine at a dose of 10 mg/m2 (later decreased to 5 mg/m2) was given on day 1 of alternate cycles.
 Toxicities were generally well tolerated.
 The overall response rate was 10% with no significant difference between treatment arms.
 Survival was also not significantly different for the arms.
 A small subset of patients (16) with metastases only to the lungs had a high complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rate of 44%.
 Responses were durable, and overall survival of this group was much better than that of the other patients.

"Lung vascular injury after administration of viable hemolysin-forming Escherichia coli in isolated rabbit lungs.
 Escherichia coli hemolysin, a transmembrane pore-forming exotoxin, is considered an important virulence factor.
 In the present study, the possible significance of hemolysin production was investigated in a model of septic lung failure through infusion of viable bacteria in isolated rabbit lungs; 10(4) to 10(7) E.
 coli/ml perfusate caused a dose- and time-dependent appearance of hemolysin, accompanied by release of potassium, thromboxane A2, and PGI2 into the perfusate.
 Concomitantly, marked pulmonary hypertension developed.
 Inhibitor studies suggested that the pressor response was predominantly mediated by pulmonary thromboxane generation.
 Administration of hemolysin-forming E.
 coli additionally caused a protracted, dose-dependent increase in the lung capillary filtration coefficient, followed by severe edema formation.
 The permeability increase was independent of lung prostanoid generation.
 An E.
 coli strain that releases an inactive form of hemolysin completely failed to provoke the described biophysical and biochemical responses.
 Preapplication of 2 x 10(8) human granulocytes was without effect in the present experimental model.
 We conclude that the hemolysin produced by low numbers of E.
 coli organisms can provoke thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension and severe vascular leakage.
 E.
 coli hemolysin and, possibly, other related cytolysins may thus contribute directly to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory failure under conditions of sepsis or pneumonia.

"Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in the surgical intensive care unit [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Apr;172(4):324]
 It is often difficult to detect the onset of parenchymal pulmonary infection (pneumonia) in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) setting.
 Clinical and laboratory parameters that usually indicate the presence of pneumonia, such as fever, elevated white blood cell count and abnormal sputum culture, may also be present in patients with nonpneumonic infection.
 Prompt diagnosis is particularly important for patients in SICU because the mortality rate associated with pneumonia in these patients may be as high as 50 per cent.
 In the SICU setting, pneumonia is best diagnosed using well-defined roentgenologic criteria.
 Treatment should consist of a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to which all sputum pathogens are sensitive.
 Such a regimen significantly reduces the mortality rate for patients with pneumonia in an SICU setting.
 Aztreonam has been found to be as effective against susceptible gram-negative bacilli as traditional agents, such as the aminoglycosides, and to have a significantly milder side effect profile.

"Facilitation of mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus with continuous intravenous thiopental.
 Mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus is associated with a significant mortality and morbidity.
 To facilitate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), we have used continuous IV thiopental (thiopentone) together with traditional ventilatory techniques.
 With this policy, we were able to achieve rapid correction of arterial blood gas tensions in a group of 20 severe asthmatics requiring IPPV.
 By 1 hour, peak airway pressure (PAP) had fallen from 58.6 +/- 15.7 to 30.2 +/- 10.9 cm H2O (p less than 0.001).
 During the same period, PaCO2 fell from 51.3 +/- 15.3 to 40.17 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and pH rose from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 7.33 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001).
 Morbidity was low and in particular, no episode of barotrauma was noted.
 All patients survived the acute attack and were successfully liberated from the ventilator.
 We conclude that these results are largely attributable to our use of early and continuous IV anesthesia induced by thiopental.

"Postpericardiotomy and postmyocardial infarction syndrome presenting as noncardiac pulmonary edema.
 Three cases are reported that describe acute pulmonary edema as an early manifestation of a postpericardiotomy or postmyocardial infarction syndrome.
 Each of these cases occurred in the presence of good left ventricular function.
 The cases suggest this syndrome occurs in immunologically primed patients who have had prior cardiac injury resulting in readily available heart antibody.
 The first report followed an acute myocardial infarction that required a temporary pacemaker, and the two other cases occurred following coronary artery bypass surgery.
 Two of the patients had a history of distant myocardial or pericardial injury, and the third patient had an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction two to three weeks before cardiac surgery.
 All three patients with pulmonary edema responded dramatically to corticosteroids, having been resistant to diuretic and pre-load and afterload reduction therapy, suggesting an autoimmune capillary injury process.
 Early recognition of such a syndrome is important since all three patients were successfully treated, and might otherwise have been confused with other causes of pulmonary edema.

"Bronchodilator treatment for partially reversible chronic obstructive airways disease.
 The effect of six weeks' treatment with inhaled terbutaline (1 mg four times a day), optimised doses of theophylline (twice a day), the combination of theophylline and terbutaline, and placebo was studied in a randomised, double blind, crossover trial.
 Thirty patients with partially reversible chronic airflow obstruction and a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 1.2 litres that improved by 25% were included in the study.
 Patients who developed non-infective exacerbations of airflow obstruction that required additional bronchodilator treatment were classed as ""treatment failures."" Such treatment failure occurred in 23 patients with placebo, in 22 patients with theophylline, in 12 patients with terbutaline, and in two patients taking the two drugs.
 Mean daily peak flow readings were highest with the combination of the two drugs, followed by terbutaline and then theophylline, and lowest with placebo.
 Thus a combination of terbutaline and theophylline was superior to either drug alone; inhaled terbutaline was superior to theophylline alone.
 Theophylline alone does not appear to have much place in the management of patients with partially reversible obstructive airways disease.

"Spectral vs. compartmental averaging of VA/Q distributions: confidence limits.
 We have investigated the method of statistical averaging as a nonparametric approach to obtain a representative ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distribution that exemplifies the family of compatible solutions for multiple inert gas elimination data.
 The variability of the compatible solutions was examined by determining the standard deviation of the statistical average.
 For six inert gases, it can be predicted that a distribution with up to seven contiguous nonzero VA/Q compartments can be uniquely recovered, whereas the compatible family becomes more diverse, the broader the distribution.
 For a given compatible family consisting of multimodal distributions with various phase relationships, the average distribution was found to display an uncharacteristically unimodal shape as a result of modal smoothing.
 To avoid this possible artifact, an alternative approach was adopted in which statistical averaging was performed in the frequency domain.
 For both deterministic and empirical data, the energy spectra of all feasible VA/Q distributions displayed a well-defined low-frequency band that was invariant within the compatible family and with a bandwidth that approximated the predicted sampling cutoff frequency.
 The nonuniqueness of the result was ascribable to a variable high-frequency band that was due to an aliasing effect.
 For a wide range of clinical data, the representative distributions resulting from compartmental and spectral averaging were indistinguishable from each other and had little variability both in the VA/Q and frequency domains.
 For these cases, therefore, the resolving power of the recovery algorithm was not critical.
 Finally, an efficient method of finding the average distribution was proposed.

"Wegener's granulomatosis with renal involvement: patient survival and correlations between initial renal function, renal histology, therapy and renal outcome.
 Patient survival and renal outcome were followed in 25 patients with biopsy confirmed Wegener's granulomatosis and renal involvement.
 Fourteen out of 25 patients required dialysis on admission, 11/25 patients did not.
 All patients were treated with a novel protocol comprising methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide.
 The median follow-up observation was 36 months (12-113 months).
 With the exception of 1 patient (who died from causes not related to Wegener's granulomatosis) all patients are alive.
 Among the patients initially requiring dialysis (n = 14) 4 are in terminal renal failure after 0, 7, 21 and 38 months respectively.
 In the nondialysis group (n = 11) only 1 patient subsequently required chronic dialysis 30 months after clinical admission.
 Renal failure was due to non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy in at least 2 patients.
 Percentage of obsolescent glomeruli and the degree of tubulointerstitial lesions, but not active glomerular lesions (crescents, necroses) predicted renal outcome.
 The major cause of renal functional impairment was relapse of Wegener's granulomatosis usually within 2 years after clinical remission.
 Therefore prolonged treatment with cyclophosphamide for at least 2 years after clinical remission is recommended.

 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether caffeine consumption affects bronchoprovocation challenge (BPC).
 DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial.
 PATIENTS: Eleven nonsmoking men, aged 18 to 42 years, with normal baseline spirometry and evidence of exercise-induced bronchospasm.
 INTERVENTION: On three separate test days, each individual received, in random order, either placebo, 5 mg/kg caffeine, or 10 mg/kg caffeine, and then underwent BPC with eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH).
 RESULTS: Caffeine (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced bronchoconstriction compared to placebo (p = 0.02).
 The reduction in bronchoconstriction correlated with the serum level of caffeine (p = 0.014).
 CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine decreases bronchoconstriction due to EVH.
 Caffeine should be eliminated from diet prior to BPC.

 The role of isoniazid prophylaxis in low-risk patients with positive Mantoux skin tests has recently been questioned.
 In general, recent research has focused on the risk/benefit ratio.
 We, therefore, decided to extend these data and apply a cost-effectiveness analysis of the routine use of isoniazid prophylaxis from a societal perspective.

"Preoperative chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: a phase II study of the Lung Cancer Study Group.
 The Lung Cancer Study Group conducted a phase II pilot study of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiotherapy) before surgery in 85 eligible patients with non-small-cell cancer limited to the chest but in whom attempted resection would have been likely to leave residual disease (advanced stage IIIA and minimal stage IIIB disease).
 Cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, was given on days 1 and 29; fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per 24 hours, was administered as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 4 and on days 29 through 32; and thoracic radiation, 30 Gy in 15 fractions, was administered on days 1 through 19.
 Two patients achieved a complete response and 46 patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 56%.
 Toxicity from chemoradiotherapy was moderate but acceptable.
 Eight weeks after therapy was initiated, 54 patients underwent thoracotomy and tumor resection was attempted: 29 (34%) had complete resection and 15 (18%) had incomplete resection.
 Although surgical dissection was generally more difficult than in patients not pretreated with chemoradiotherapy, there was no apparent increase in postoperative complications.
 In 8 patients (9%), no viable tumor was detected pathologically in the resection specimen.
 Of the 18 patients whose tumors were completely resected and had disease recurrence, none had recurrence only in the chest, 12 (67%) had recurrence only in distant sites, and 3 developed second primary tumors.
 Median survival of all patients was 13 months.
 The overall results do not indicate a major benefit from this preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with advanced but potentially resectable non-small-cell lung cancer.
 These results suggest a need to define better the relative roles of preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

 Actinomyces may cause purulent pericarditis that evolves into cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis.
 Clues to the identity of the causative organism (e.g., draining sinus tracts and the presence of sulfur granules) are frequently absent, and cultures often fail to yield the organism.
 Histologic examination of material obtained by biopsy is often necessary to make the diagnosis.
 Most cases originate from a thoracopulmonary site of actinomycosis and spread directly to the pericardium.
 Widespread dissemination to extrathoracic organs is uncommon.
 Treatment consists of high-dose, long-term antimicrobial therapy as well as drainage of the pericardial space.

"Plasma prostanoids in neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Influence of meconium aspiration.
 Thromboxane B2 may be a mediator of neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension.
 Elevated levels of plasma thromboxane and prostacyclin have been described previously in hypoxic newborn infants with neonatal pulmonary hypertension.
 We measured serial plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (stable metabolite of prostacyclin) in 21 newborn infants with severe respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
 We sought to study (1) the evolution of plasma prostanoids in pulmonary hypertensive infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and (2) whether different pulmonary hypertensive diagnostic subgroups have distinctive prostanoid profiles.
 Our data indicated that infants with meconium aspiration had significantly lower levels of plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than did infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension but no meconium aspiration.
 Levels of all infants decreased progressively as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support continued.

"Rising mortality from cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the pattern of mortality ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and to identify factors that might be important in the aetiology of the disease; and to assess the validity of death certification of the disease.
 DESIGN--A retrospective examination of mortality ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in England and Wales between 1979 and 1988 with analysis, by multiple logistic regression, of independent effects of age, sex, region of residence, and social class as indicated by occupation on data for 1979-87; also a retrospective review of hospital records of patients certified as having died of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in Nottingham and of the certified cause of death of patients known to have had the disease.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Time trends in mortality nationally; effects on mortality of age, sex, and region of residence; validity of death certification in Nottingham.
 RESULTS--The annual number of deaths ascribed to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis doubled from 336 in 1979 to 702 in 1988, the increase occurring mainly at ages over 65.
 Mortality standardised for age for both sexes likewise increased steadily over the period.
 Deaths due to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis were commoner in men (odds ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 2.11 to 2.33) and increased substantially with age, being 7.84 (7.24 to 8.49) times higher in subjects aged much greater than 75 than those aged 45-64.
 Odds ratios of death due to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis adjusted for age and sex were increased in the traditionally industrialised central areas of England and Wales (p less than 0.02, maximum odds ratio between regions 1.25), but no significant increase in odds of death was found for manual occupations.
 Of 23 people whose deaths were registered in Nottingham as having been due to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, 19 were ascertained from clinical records to have had the disease.
 Only 17 of 45 patients known to have had cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis in life were recorded as having died from the disease.
 CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic accuracy of death certification of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis is high, but the number of deaths recorded as being due to the disease may underestimate the number of patients dying with the disease by up to half.
 Mortality due to the disease is increasing, and the male predominance and regional differences in mortality suggest that environmental factors are important in its aetiology.

"Inhibition by methylprednisolone of leukocyte-induced pulmonary damage.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was twofold: the development of a chronic model of leukocyte-mediated pulmonary injury and the evaluation of the protective effects of methylprednisolone.
 Rabbits were inoculated ip with zymosan.
 Blood gases and circulating leukocytes were evaluated.
 Survivors were killed on day 10 for microscopic studies and for the evaluation of lung lipid peroxidation through the by-product malondialdehyde.
 RESULTS: Intraperitoneal zymosan resulted in a marked decrease of Pao2 and circulating leukocytes, and increased cellularity of alveolar septa, interstitial edema, and increased lung malondialdehyde.
 Pulmonary damage was partially prevented when methylprednisolone was administered before zymosan inoculation, but not when methylprednisolone was given 24 hr later.
 CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that a local nonseptic inflammatory stimulus may provoke remote changes to the lungs and that methylprednisolone may counteract the process only if it is administered before or very early after the onset of inflammation.

"Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava.
 The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 10 dogs with acute thrombosis and two dogs with chronic thrombosis.
 In eight of these animals, the clots were trapped with the clot-trapper device, then a mechanical thrombectomy device was used to destroy the clots.
 In 10 animals, including eight with in vitro thrombi and two with in situ thrombi, thrombi were efficiently trapped with the clot-trapper device.
 In two animals, pulmonary embolism occurred because of a discrepancy between the diameter of the inferior vena cava and the diameter of the bag opening.
 After increasing the size of the loop to match the diameter of the inferior vena cava, trapping of all thrombi was possible in both experiments (acute and chronic thrombosis).
 The clot-trapper device, in conjunction with an embolectomy balloon catheter and/or a mechanical thrombectomy device, facilitates the removal of thrombi from the inferior vena cava and iliac veins.

"Cyclosporine and chronic sarcoidosis.
 Two patients with progressive sarcoidosis who had poor responses and side effects from corticosteroid therapy were treated with cyclosporine.
 Cyclosporine suppressed conventional markers of inflammation and there was clinical improvement in one patient, but the disease recurred when therapy was discontinued.
 The second patient who had diabetes mellitus developed unstable glucose metabolism when given cyclosporine.
 This unstable diabetes mellitus together with side effects of nausea and vomiting resulted in weight loss and inadequate serum therapeutic levels that was associated with a poor therapeutic response to the cyclosporine.
 The major side effects in both patients were headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, but there was no renal dysfunction.
 We conclude that while corticosteroids remain the mainstay of sarcoid therapy, when these drugs have not been successful for the skin manifestations of the disease, a trial of cyclosporine may be justified.

"Role of basic fibroblast growth factor in revascularization of rabbit tracheal autografts.
 Despite omentopexy of the bronchial anastomosis, donor airway ischemia remains a problem after lung transplantation.
 This study examined the hypothesis that surface abrasion and topical application of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) would enhance omental revascularization of trachea in a rabbit heterotopic autograft model.
 Tracheal segments were excised, primary tracheal anastomoses performed, and the segments placed in the peritoneal cavity wrapped in omentum.
 Animals were randomized to one of six groups according to tracheal segment treatment: control, surgical abrasion, Surgicel wrap with topical bFGF, Surgicel wrap with bFGF vehicle, Gelfoam wrap with bFGF, and topical bFGF alone.
 One week later, animals were heparinized, perfused with Aquablak dye, and killed.
 Tracheal segments were excised and sectioned for light microscopic quantitative assessment of viability and dye perfusion.
 There was no significant improvement in viability or perfusion between abraded tracheal segments or segments treated with bFGF/Gelfoam or bFGF alone when compared with control segments.
 Airways wrapped in Surgicel had significantly greater ischemic injury compared with the control group, regardless of bFGF application.
 Neither surgical abrasion nor topical bFGF increased omental revascularization of transplanted tracheal segments after 7 days.

"Complement activation is a secondary rather than a causative factor in rabbit pulmonary artery ischemia/reperfusion injury.
 We have previously demonstrated that reperfusion of a rabbit lung in vivo after 24 h of unilateral pulmonary artery occlusion results in edema, transient leukopenia, and intravascular leukocyte aggregation.
 We hypothesized that complement was activated by reperfusion and that this in turn contributed to lung injury.
 In the preliminary phase of the study, we found that ischemia followed by reperfusion resulted in a drop in C3 to 15 +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM) of the prereperfusion value as compared with no change in a group of control animals that had undergone an identical thoracotomy but without pulmonary artery occlusion and reperfusion (p less than 0.05).
 We then studied three groups of animals to determine if complement depletion with cobra venom factor (CVF) prior to ischemia and reperfusion would prevent the injury.
 Rabbits treated with CVF but without occlusion and reperfusion did not develop significant lung edema, with left and right lung wet/dry ratios of 5.32 +/- 0.11 and 5.26 +/- 0.12, respectively.
 For rabbits that were not treated with CVF but underwent ischemia and reperfusion, the comparable numbers were 6.15 +/- 0.36 and 5.19 +/- 0.32 (p less than 0.05 for right versus left).
 For CVF-treated rabbits that underwent ischemia and reperfusion, the right/left difference persisted (6.77 +/- 0.48 versus 5.35 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.01).
 Immunocytochemistry documented C3 deposition in non-CVF rabbits that underwent ischemia and reperfusion but not in CVF-treated rabbits.
 We conclude that ischemia/reperfusion of the lung results in complement activation, but it is not a complement-dependent injury.

"Pulmonary embolectomy: a 20-year experience at one center 
 Between 1968 and 1988, 96 consecutive patients with acute massive pulmonary embolism underwent pulmonary embolectomy under cardiopulmonary bypass.
 The operative mortality rate was 37.5%.
 We analyzed 12 clinical and hemodynamic variables by univariate and multivariate analyses to assess the predictive factors of postoperative outcome.
 Multivariate analysis disclosed that cardiac arrest and associated cardiopulmonary disease were independent predictors of operative death.
 Long-term follow-up (range, 2 to 144 months; mean, 56 months) information was available for 55 of the 60 discharged patients: 6 had died, and 5 complained of persistent mild or severe exertional dyspnea (New York Heart Association class II).
 These results help assess the preoperative risk in patients undergoing pulmonary embolectomy.
 They also show that, in the few patients who do not benefit from optimal medical therapy, pulmonary embolectomy remains an acceptable procedure in view of the long-term results.

"Exercise testing in the assessment of pulmonary disease.
 In this chapter, the different types of exercise tests and the indications for requesting a particular type of test have been discussed.
 The normal physiological responses to exercise have been reviewed and examples of the abnormal responses seen in a variety of disease states that have been discussed.
 The relatively small number of these responses limits the specificity of exercise tests in actually establishing a diagnosis, but can be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.
 Perhaps exercise tests are most valuable in cases where the patient's symptoms are mainly limited to exercise and where investigations done at rest have failed to resolve a diagnostic question.
 When exercise testing is used under these circumstances, it serves a unique function in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary disease.

"Initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer: value of routine radioisotope bone scanning.
 The exclusion of bone metastases is important in the initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, though there is debate about whether bone scans should be performed routinely or restricted to patients who present with clinical or laboratory indicators suggesting skeletal metastases.
 In a prospective study of 110 consecutive patients referred for initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, we assessed the sensitivity of a group of clinical indicators (chest pain, skeletal pain, bone tenderness on physical examination, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum calcium) for the presence of skeletal metastases as determined by bone scanning.
 The final staging result was validated with follow up data over at least three years.
 At the initial staging 37 of 110 bone scans (34%) showed areas of increased uptake, of which only nine were confirmed to be metastases (by tomography, computed tomography, or biopsy).
 Half the patients (55) had at least one clinical indicator suggesting skeletal metastases, including all patients with proved skeletal metastases.
 Thus the sensitivity of these clinical indicators was 100% and the specificity 54%.
 Within one year three of 27 patients with non-confirmed positive bone scans had skeletal metastases, one of which was in the area that had shown increased uptake initially.
 All these patients had clinical indicators for skeletal metastases and all had inoperable advanced tumours.
 Four of 69 patients with an initially negative bone scan developed skeletal metastases within one year.
 It is concluded that in non-small cell lung cancer bone scanning can be restricted to patients with clinical indicators for skeletal metastases.
 This approach reduces the number of bone scans and consecutive investigations without loss of sensitivity in the detection of skeletal metastases.

"Soluble interleukin-2 receptor in sera of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis 
 Interleukin-2 receptor, the complex of IL-2R-alpha and/or IL-2R-beta, is expressed mainly on T-lymphocytes, and the soluble form of IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha) has been reported to be detected in the serum of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders or disease characterized by the cellular immune reaction.
 We measured serum sIL-2R-alpha levels among patients with pulmonary diseases and found that sIL-2R-alpha levels were significantly elevated in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (1,327 +/- 209 U/ml) and sarcoidosis (1,037 +/- 115 U/ml) when compared with healthy volunteers (468 +/- 49 U/ml, p less than 0.01).
 Among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the sIL-2R-alpha levels were high in sera from patients with extensive parenchymal lesions on the roentgenogram (2,745 +/- 705 U/ml) and patients with tuberculous pleurisy (2,111 +/- 679 U/ml).
 In contrast, the sIL-2R-alpha levels in tuberculous patients with minimal lesion (455 +/- 92 U/ml) or moderate lesion (1,082 +/- 189 U/ml) were not significantly elevated when compared with healthy volunteers.
 After the treatment with antituberculosis agents, serum sIL-2R-alpha levels decreased in accordance with improvement of roentgenographic findings and laboratory data.
 These results suggest that serum sIL-2R-alpha level may be useful as a monitor for the disease activity in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

"Lung function in former intravenous drug abusers: the effect of ubiquitous cigarette smoking.
 PURPOSE: To determine whether former intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) demonstrate reductions in pulmonary function, especially in the diffusing capacity (DLCO), after adjustment for the effects of their ubiquitous smoking habit.
 Knowledge of baseline DLCO in this high-risk group is important in evaluating the effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and ensuing opportunistic infections.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measurements of single-breath DLCO, forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were compared with predictive values that adjust for the effects of smoking.
 Patients were 98 ambulatory former IVDAs regularly attending a methadone maintenance program (62 men and 36 women; 94 current smokers, two ex-smokers, and two nonsmokers).
 RESULTS: When adjusted for smoking, FEV1 and DLCO were no different in the study sample than in cross sections of the general population: mean FEV1 105% predicted (men) and 97% predicted (women), mean DLCO 95% predicted (men) and 99% predicted (women).
 Eleven percent of the IVDAs had abnormal values for DLCO; only one subject had a value less than 50% of predicted.
 CONCLUSIONS: Most former IVDAs who regularly attend an ambulatory methadone program have normal DLCO values when the effects of smoking are taken into account.
 A decrease in DLCO in such subjects is presumptive evidence of superimposed disease, most likely related to opportunistic infections or HIV-associated malignancy or alveolitis.

"Dose-intensity meta-analysis of chemotherapy regimens in small-cell carcinoma of the lung.
 To determine if chemotherapy dose intensity (DI) influences treatment outcome, 60 published studies in limited- and extensive-stage small-cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL) were retrospectively analyzed for relationship between intended DI and response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or median survival (MS).
 Agents used in the regimens included cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (A), vincristine (V), etoposide (E), and cisplatin (P).
 Relative DI (RDI) of each study regimen was calculated against a reference regimen, and weighted regression analysis was used.
 Additionally, analysis of individual drug RDI within combinations was performed.
 For CAV, increasing RDI of the regimen showed no correlation with outcome.
 For the individual drugs, C RDI correlated positively, while A RDI correlated negatively with attainment of CR in limited disease, but both only after unduly influential observations were eliminated.
 In extensive-stage disease, A RDI correlated positively with CR+, PR but only in randomized trials, and this correlation lost statistical significance after unduly influential observations were eliminated.
 For CAE and CAVE, the RDI of the regimens correlated positively with MS in extensive-stage disease as did the C RDI.
 In limited disease, the C RDI correlated negatively with MS.
 For EP, no significant correlations were seen.
 We conclude that DI-outcome correlations are not consistent for these chemotherapy regimens in SCCL.
 Meta-analysis of retrospective data can generate hypotheses for testing in prospective clinical trials, but study sample and method of analysis can appreciably affect conclusions.

"Serial measurement of pulmonary mechanics assists in weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in neonates with respiratory failure.
 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a highly invasive therapy for intractable neonatal respiratory failure, and serious complications may occur with increasing duration of bypass.
 Weaning from bypass is empirical at present.
 Thus, there is a need to accurately predict when infants can be successfully decannulated.
 We hypothesized that pulmonary mechanics would reflect lung recovery and, therefore, predict successful weaning from ECMO.
 We measured pulmonary mechanics daily in 22 neonates, at gestational age of 37.8 +/- 0.6 weeks (SE) requiring ECMO for severe respiratory failure (oxygen index 66 +/- 6).
 Pulmonary resistance (Rpul), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), and tidal volume (VT) were measured.
 Rpul did not predict lung recovery.
 Cdyn within 24 hours of starting ECMO was 0.3 +/- 0.04 ml/cm H2O.
 Cdyn within 24 hours of weaning from ECMO was 1.2 +/- 0.09 ml/cm H2O (p less than 0.001).
 All 22 infants had Cdyn greater than 0.6 ml/cm H2O at the time of decannulation, but four infants (20 percent) with Cdyn less than 0.6 ml/cm H2O could not be weaned from ECMO within 20 hours (p less than 0.01).
 Thus, a minimum Cdyn of 0.6 ml/cm H2O is associated with successful weaning from ECMO.
 Cdyn of 0.8 ml/cm H2O provided better overall discrimination between those who could be successfully weaned from ECMO.
 We conclude that serial measurement of dynamic pulmonary compliance predicts successful weaning from ECMO.

"Indirect laryngoscopic approach for injection of botulinum toxin in spasmodic dysphonia.
 Spasmodic dysphonia is a focal dystonia that causes a loss of the fine control of intrinsic laryngeal muscles and produces a strained staccato voice.
 Temporary relief from symptoms has been reported in patients treated with botulinum toxin percutaneously injected into the thyroarytenoid muscle.
 A newly developed method of treatment differs from reported methods by increasing the accuracy of botulinum toxin placement, reducing soft tissue trauma, and applying basic scientific information about the functional histology of intrinsic laryngeal musculature.
 Sixteen patients with primarily adductor spasmodic dysphonia were treated.
 Initial assessment included laryngeal examination by indirect laryngoscopy, videoendoscopy, and stroboscopy, neurology examination (including laryngeal EMG), and vocal function studies with acoustic analysis and aerodynamic studies.
 A device originally designed for collagen injection allowed the precise microdelivery of toxin to the thyroarytenoid muscle.
 Indirect laryngoscopy was used to direct the needle, in an attempt to cover a broad area of motor end plates.
 The minimally effective dose was titrated for each patient, to avoid paralysis and preserve laryngeal function.
 All patients showed improved voices after treatment.
 There were no major complications.
 The basic technique can be performed in the otolaryngologist's office and does not require electromyography equipment or expertise.

 Our results show that lymphocytes from patients with bronchogenic carcinoma can acquire LAK activity, but the level of activity acquired was significantly lower compared with lymphocytes from 25 control subjects when IL-2 cultures were supplemented with 10% autologous human serum (AHS) (15.6% +/- 2.1% specific release versus 26.0% +/- 2.9% specific release, P = 0.004).
 The LAK activity, defined as cytotoxicity of an NK-resistant cell line, of the patients' lymphocytes was augmented when cells were cultured with both IL-2 and IFN compared with IL-2 alone (P = 0.0001, paired t-test).
 Control subjects were unchanged (P = 0.09).
 There was no significant difference between groups of patients with different histologic types of tumor or different stages of disease.
 The NK activity, defined as killing of NK-sensitive K-562 target cells, of the patients' lymphocytes was not significantly different from that of the controls' lymphocytes (42.8% +/- 3.0% specific release versus 49.3% +/- 3.3% specific release, P = 0.16).

"Initial airway function is a risk factor for recurrent wheezing respiratory illnesses during the first three years of life. Group Health Medical Associates.
 We recently reported a significant relationship between lung function measured prior to any lower respiratory tract illness and subsequent wheezing illnesses during the first year of life (N Engl J Med 1988; 319:1112-7).
 Follow-up has continued for this group of infants during the second and third years of life.
 When compared with never wheezers, infants who wheezed during the first year of life and had at least one additional lower respiratory illness had 22% lower initial levels of an indirect index of airway conductance derived from the shape of tidal breathing curves (p less than or equal to 0.01), 22% lower respiratory conductance (p less than or equal to 0.05), 25% lower maximal flows at the end-expiratory point (p less than or equal to 0.01), and 10% lower functional residual capacity (p less than or equal to 0.05).
 Infants who wheezed only once during the first 3 yr of life or who started wheezing during the second year of life had normal tidal breathing curves but significantly lower maximal expiratory flows (p less than or equal to 0.05).
 Their functional residual capacity was also lower than that of never wheezers (p less than or equal to 0.05).
 We conclude that diminished initial airway function may be a predisposing factor for recurrent wheezing respiratory illnesses starting in the first year of life.
 Infants who will have only one wheezing respiratory illness or who will start wheezing after the first year of life seem to have lower levels for some but not for all lung function tests performed in this study.

"Hyperresponsiveness of the extrathoracic airway in patients with captopril-induced cough 
 It has been suggested that cough from captopril may originate from an increased sensitivity of receptors in the extrathoracic airway (EA).
 To explore this hypothesis, we assessed the responsiveness of EA and bronchi and the cough sensitivity to inhaled histamine in nine hypertensive patients with captopril-induced cough (group 1) during treatment and one month after withdrawal of the drug treatment.
 Nine patients who were asymptomatic while receiving captopril (group 2) and nine patients receiving no current treatment (group 3) served as controls.
 The EA responsiveness was assessed by using the maximal midinspiratory flow (MIF50) as an arbitrary index of EA constriction and was expressed as the histamine concentration causing a 25 percent decrease in MIF50 (PC25MIF50).
 PC15FEV1 was the index of bronchial responsiveness and PCcough (dose causing five or more coughs) was that of cough sensitivity.
 Airway hyperresponsiveness (EA-HR or BHR) was diagnosed when PC25MIF50 or PC15FEV1 were 8 mg/ml or lower.
 Patients with captopril-cough, as compared with controls, had significantly lower values of PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough; EA-HR and BHR were found, respectively, in seven and three of these patients and in none of the control subjects.
 In all the patients of group 1, cough and EA-HR resolved after withdrawal of captopril treatment, while BHR persisted in one.
 PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough were all significantly improved.
 Our findings suggest that cough during captopril therapy may originate from receptors in the EA.

 To test the hypothesis that acute hypotension resulting from pneumothorax would be associated with severe brain injury (grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage), 67 very low birthweight (VLBW) infants of 32 weeks' gestation or less with respiratory distress syndrome and pneumothorax were studied.
 Thirty six had pneumothorax associated with systemic hypotension and 31 had pneumothorax with normal blood pressure.

 The 5-year survival rate was 80% for group A, 74% for group B, and 51% for group C (group B versus group C, p less than 0.01).
 Of the 121 patients who underwent complete resection and were followed up for 5 years, 41% had recurrence, 8% with local recurrence and 33% with distant metastasis.
 Therefore, it is important to do as complete a resection as possible together with mediastinal lymphadenectomy.
 Efforts to detect systemic spread should be made at the time of preoperative evaluation, even when the lung tumor is small.

"Klebsiella pneumonia in the modern era: clinicoradiographic correlations.
 A classic clinical and radiographic picture of Klebsiella pneumonia has emerged in the literature.
 Patients are typically male, older than 48 years, and have a history of chronic alcoholism.
 The majority of these pneumonias are community acquired.
 Bulging interlobar fissures and cavitation are radiographic findings said to be distinctive for Klebsiella pneumonia.
 We prospectively studied 15 cases of bacteremically proven Klebsiella pneumonia and found clinical and radiographic features strikingly different from those described in the literature.
 Immunosuppression (from corticosteroids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, neutropenia, hematologic malignancy, and transplantation) now rivals alcoholism as the primary risk factor.
 Cases tended to be nosocomial rather than community acquired.
 Neither bulging interlobar fissure nor cavitation was seen in any case.
 The right upper lobe was involved in 11 of our 15 cases.
 Pneumonia due to Klebsiella oxytoca was more likely to be isolated from patients with bilateral infiltrates, while Klebsiella pneumoniae was more likely in patients with unilateral infiltrates.

"Monoclonal immunofluorescence compared with silver stain for investigating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 Two hundred and eighty two specimens from 220 patients positive for HIV with respiratory tract symptoms, or febrile illness, or both, were examined for the presence of Pneumocystis carinii.
 Specimens were either induced sputum samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids.
 To establish the optimal method for laboratory diagnosis a comparison was made of detection of the organism by use of monoclonal antibody and immunofluorescence with conventional silver staining methods.
 Three commercially available reagents for immunofluorescence were also compared.
 Immunofluorescence was significantly more sensitive than the silver stain and the best results for immunofluorescence were obtained using.

"High incidence of cardiopulmonary complications associated with implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus in patients with advanced neurologic disease.
 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to examine the cardiopulmonary complications of a group of patients who had undergone implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus for treatment of neurologic disease.
 DESIGN: Prospective study with partially matched historical controls.
 SETTING: Tertiary care community medical center.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus.
 These patients were compared with respect to their cardiopulmonary complications with a control group who had undergone craniotomy and then compared with a control group who had undergone only abdominal surgery.
 RESULTS: In the study group, six patients developed major postoperative complications including development of large pleural effusions, lobar atelectasis, pneumonia, upper airway obstruction, and cardiac arrest.
 Three patients had minor complications including development of small pleural effusions, subsegmental atelectasis, purulent bronchitis, mild congestive heart failure, and atrial flutter/fibrillation.
 One patient had an unremarkable postoperative course.
 The first control group, whose only surgery was a craniotomy, had only one major complication.
 The second control group, the abdominal surgery control group, had one major and five minor complications.
 CONCLUSION: The particular neurologic disease, its severity, and the type of surgery performed appear to be causative factors in the high incidence of complications in the study group.

"Natural killer cell activity in a rat model of amiodarone-induced interstitial lung disease.
 The role of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung disease is controversial.
 Increases in the percentages of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar fluid of both patients and animals with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have been reported.
 To assess whether these lymphocytes are functionally activated, we measured natural killer cell activity in the lungs and blood of rats with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity.
 Amiodarone treated rats exhibited pathologic evidence of amiodarone-induced lung disease after one week of treatment and this injury was sustained and more extensive during the remainder of the study period.
 Control rats had histologically normal lungs.
 Blood NK activity was equally present in both amiodarone-treated and control groups and was not significantly different over the course of the study (16 +/- 3 percent and 13 +/- 2 percent, respectively; p greater than 0.05).
 Thus, NK cells were activated only in the lungs of rats treated with amiodarone, suggesting a local immune response in the lung.
 These data support the concept that lymphocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of amiodarone-induced lung disease.

"Chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease: comparison of diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution and conventional CT.
 We compared the accuracies of high-resolution CT (HRCT) and conventional CT in determining the specific diagnoses in 75 consecutive patients with chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease.
 Without knowledge of clinical or pathologic data, two reviewers independently assessed three separate sets of CT scans in random order: three HRCT scans, three 10-mm collimation CT scans obtained at the same levels as the HRCT scans, and a complete conventional CT scan.
 The HRCT scans were obtained at the level of the aortic arch, tracheal carina, and 1 cm above the right hemidiaphragm by using 1.5-mm collimation and a high spatial resolution algorithm.
 Observers gave the most likely diagnosis along with their degree of diagnostic confidence.
 The correct diagnosis, irrespective of confidence level, was reached with 71% of the HRCT scans and with 72% of both the corresponding 10-mm and complete conventional CT scans.
 Confidence level 1 (definite) was reached with 49% of HRCT scans, 31% of corresponding 10-mm scans, and 43% of complete conventional CT examinations; the correct diagnosis was made in 92%, 96%, and 94% of those examinations, respectively.
 In none of the patients were findings on the limited HRCT scan normal when findings on the conventional CT scan were abnormal.
 We conclude that in most patients with chronic infiltrative lung disease a specific diagnosis can be made by obtaining a limited number of HRCT scans.

"A nationwide survey of antibiotic prescribing patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with bacterial pneumonia.
 Antibiotic prescribing information was prospectively collected on 1822 hospitalized patients treated for suspected or documented bacterial pneumonia.
 Antibacterial therapy with a single antibiotic was employed in more than 50 percent of the patients, with cefazolin, cefuroxime, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone sodium representing the most commonly employed agents.
 Combination therapy using two antibiotics was employed in approximately 30 percent of patients with the aminoglycosides, particularly gentamicin, used extensively.
 A satisfactory outcome was achieved in approximately 80 percent of patients with a community- or institutional-acquired pneumonia; only 66 percent of nosocomial pneumonias had a satisfactory outcome.
 An important observation was the apparently common practice of switching patients to an oral antibiotic regimen after an average of seven days of antibiotics and subsequently discharging the patient.
 No difference was observed in the patterns of clinical response or duration of therapy for culture-positive versus culture-negative patients.
 The results of this surveillance program can serve as a basis for comparison of institution-specific drug utilization evaluation programs.

"Interstitial lung disease.
 The interstitial lung diseases are comprised of a group of pulmonary disorders characterized clinically by diffuse infiltrates on the chest radiograph and histologically by distortion of the gas exchanging portion of the lung.
 The physiologic correlates are restriction of lung volumes and impaired oxygenation.
 The term ""interstitial"" when applied to these diseases is actually a misnomer because it implies that the inflammatory process is limited specifically to the area between the alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial basement membranes.
 The diseases currently grouped as ""interstitial"" also frequently involve the alveolar epithelium, alveolar space, pulmonary microvasculature, and less commonly, the respiratory bronchioles, larger airways, and even the pleura.
 The enormous differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease can be made manageable by understanding that pneumoconiosis, drug-induced disease, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis account for over 80% of the responsible entities and can usually be identified from the patient's history.
 The nine remaining diseases/disease categories include: sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia, histiocytosis X, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease, granulomatous vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, lymphomatoid granulomatosis), Goodpasture's syndrome, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
 The diagnosis of a specific interstitial lung disease can be made via various means including the patient's history, specific serologies, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and biopsy of extrathoracic tissues or open lung biopsy.
 A directed diagnostic approach can be formulated based on an understanding of these techniques and a thorough knowledge of the clinical presentations and specific diagnostic criteria for each of the major diseases.
 This monograph will serve as a guide for the clinician to use in evaluating and treating patients with interstitial lung disease.
 We begin by reviewing the clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and management of specific interstitial lung diseases excluding pulmonary infection, neoplasm, and sarcoidosis.
 Pneumoconiosis and drug-induced syndromes are not discussed in detail, but the agents responsible and pertinent exposures are presented in tabular form in the discussion of the general diagnostic approach.

"Management of oil of citronella poisoning.
 The management for ingestion of oil of citronella, an essential oil, has traditionally been rigorous, including dilution with milk or oil, and gastric lavage or emesis, taking care to prevent aspiration.
 Recently our Centre handled five oil of citronella poisonings and their outcomes led us to review our management protocol which had been based on information from standard poisoning texts.
 The source data used to determine the human toxicity of oil of citronella and the appropriate management of poisoning included a case report of a fatal ingestion of oil of citronella in a child.
 On scrutiny, however, the management of this poisoning included now out-moded techniques, giving rise to uncertainties in establishing the true cause of the child's death.
 Our own experiences indicate that advice given in standard texts based on poisoning cases managed with out-moded techniques should be carefully evaluated.

"Size distribution of human lung elastin-derived peptide antigens generated in vitro and in vivo.
 The protease-antiprotease hypothesis of emphysema development suggests that degradation of elastin in the lung interstitium may give rise to abnormal quantities of circulating elastin-derived peptides (EDP) during periods of inflammation.
 Recent studies have shown a relationship between emphysema and high levels of EDP in human plasma.
 This report characterizes elastin digests on the basis of antigenicity, size, and method of preparation, as well as the size distribution of EDP found in the plasmas of nonsmokers, smokers, and emphysema patients.
 Gel filtration of elastin digests prepared by hydrolysis of human lung elastin using a low (1:500) ratio of neutrophil elastase to elastin generated a broad protein peak of approximately 70,000 daltons.
 In contrast, a high (1:25) ratio of neutrophil elastase to human lung elastin gave a broad protein peak, with a size distribution in the 10,000 to 30,000 dalton range.
 This digest showed distinct immunochemical properties.
 A polyclonal antibody directed against the low-ratio digest showed a minimum detection of 2 ng/ml for the homologous antigen but required 1,000 ng/ml of the high-ratio digest for detectable inhibition in an indirect ELISA assay.
 Gel filtration of plasmas from normal nonsmokers and the majority of normal smokers revealed a single immunoreactive EDP fraction of approximately 70,000 daltons.
 Plasmas from selected normal smokers and emphysema patients with high levels of circulating EDP (greater than 90 ng/ml) fractionated into a complex pattern of peptides in which the 70,000 dalton component represented 50% of the immunoreactive material and several lower molecular weight peptides represented the remaining circulating elastin antigens.

"Clinical spectrum of endobronchial tuberculosis in elderly patients.
 We describe 11 elderly patients with bacteriologically proved endobronchial tuberculosis, representing 15% of our 73 geriatric patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in the period 1980 to 1987.
 In seven (64%) of the 11 patients, an incorrect diagnosis was initially made.
 Cough, mostly nonproductive, was invariably present, and general symptoms (fever, anorexia, weight loss) predominated over specific pulmonary symptoms.
 The radiographic features were rather ""unusual"": in only two (18%) of the 11 cases, apicoposterior consolidations with or without cavitation were found.
 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed a range of endobronchial abnormalities that included ulcerations, mass lesions, and fibrostenoses.
 Antituberculous treatment generally led to satisfactory results.
 Still, residual bronchostenosis was observed in four (57%) of seven patients in whom a control bronchoscopy was done.
 In one of these four patients, a pneumonectomy had to be performed for uncontrollable retro-obstructive infections, and in another, repeated endoscopic dilatations were effective.
 In elderly patients, endobronchial tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in the presence of chronic cough.
 In these patients, the chest roentgenogram may be clear or suggestive of bronchial carcinoma or pneumonitis.

"Tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum in lung cancer: evaluation with pneumothorax CT.
 For preoperative evaluation of chest wall and mediastinal invasion by lung cancer, computed tomography (CT), combined with artificial pneumothorax (pneumothorax CT), was performed in 43 patients with lung cancer in whom conventional CT scans showed that the mass was contiguous to the chest wall (n = 30) and/or mediastinum (n = 25) but without evidence of definite tumor invasion.
 Invasion was diagnosed on the basis of whether an air space existed between the mass and the adjacent structures.
 In three patients pneumothorax was not produced.
 After the procedure, four patients developed symptomatic pneumothorax, and one, subcutaneous emphysema.
 Comparison of diagnoses based on findings at pneumothorax CT, surgery, and pathologic examination showed that pneumothorax CT is 100% accurate for chest wall invasion and 76% accurate for mediastinal invasion.
 The authors conclude that this procedure is helpful in accurate evaluation of the T criterion in lung cancer, especially for patients in whom findings at conventional CT suggest tumor invasion of the chest wall and mediastinum.

"Immunohistochemical evaluation of seven monoclonal antibodies for differentiation of pleural mesothelioma from lung adenocarcinoma.
 A panel of seven monoclonal antibodies including anti-vimentin, anti-keratin markers AE1/AE3 and EAB902, human milk fat globule (HMFG-2), B72.3, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and anti-Leu-M1 were used for an immunoperoxidase staining assay to determine their value in the differentiation of pleural mesothelioma from lung adenocarcinoma.
 Anti-vimentin positively identified 86% of the mesotheliomas and none of the adenocarcinomas.
 AE1/AE3, EAB902, and B72.3 reacted with a high percentage of both mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma specimens.
 With HMFG-2, both membrane and cytoplasmic staining was observed in 92% of the adenocarcinomas and in 14% of the mesotheliomas, whereas 26% of the mesotheliomas only exhibited membrane staining.
 Eighty percent of the adenocarcinomas and 8% of the mesothelioma tissues stained with anti-Leu-M1.
 Anti-CEA did not react with any of the 50 mesotheliomas tested but did react with 95% of the lung adenocarcinomas tested.
 From this study, it was concluded that anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 were the most effective of the seven tumor markers evaluated; and that 100% of the pleural mesothelioma tissues could be correctly differentiated from lung adenocarcinomas using a panel consisting of anti-vimentin, HMFG-2, anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 monoclonal antibodies.

"Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage after bone marrow transplantation: radiographic findings in 39 patients.
 Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication after bone marrow transplantation.
 We investigated the radiographic abnormalities that occurred in 39 transplantation patients with a diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and correlated the findings with the patients' clinical course.
 The initial radiographic abnormalities after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage developed an average of 11 days after bone marrow transplantation, and the radiographic abnormalities preceded the clinical diagnosis by an average of 3 days.
 Twenty-seven patients initially had bilateral radiographic abnormalities; 10 initially had unilateral abnormalities (seven in the right lung, three in the left lung).
 Two patients had normal chest radiographs throughout their clinical course.
 All 37 patients with radiographic abnormalities had abnormalities involving the central portion of the lung, primarily the middle and lower lung zones.
 The initial radiographic pattern was interstitial in 27 and alveolar in 10.
 In 24 patients, radiographic abnormalities were initially judged to be mild; three were severe from the onset.
 Radiographic abnormalities rapidly worsened in most patients over 6 days.
 In 30 patients, diffuse bilateral radiographic abnormalities involving all lung zones developed.
 Eleven patients persisted in having only interstitial radiographic abnormalities; 26 had a confluent alveolar pattern.
 At the height of radiographic abnormalities, 27 cases were judged to be severe, and only one case was judged to be mild.
 The mortality rate in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was 77%.
 The radiographic abnormalities of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are nonspecific and usually precede the clinical diagnosis.
 The clinical course after hemorrhage is short, often resulting in death.

"Community-acquired pneumonia: evidence of functional inactivation of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor.
 Quantitative and qualitative elastase inhibitory capacity (EIC) alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1 PI) was measured in pulmonary arterial and systemic arterial blood of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
 Eleven patients with uncomplicated CAP were compared with 16 patients with fulminating pneumonia requiring intensive care management.
 An appropriate increase in quantitative alpha 1 PI was demonstrated in all patients.
 A significant functional inactivation of alpha 1 PI was demonstrated in the ICU-treated patients that was not apparent in the uncomplicated CAP patients (p less than .01).
 This low EIC returned to normal 4 wk after hospital discharge in all survivors.
 A significant (p less than .02) difference in EIC between the pulmonary arterial and systemic arterial blood was found in the nonsurvivors on admission, which suggests that alpha 1 PI is inactivated in the lungs of patients with fulminating CAP.
 The present data demonstrate that alpha 1 PI is functionally inactivated in patients with fulminating CAP.
 This low serum functional alpha 1 PI may result in proteolytic lung damage and an unfavorable outcome.

"Mechanisms of disease in Hantavirus infection: pathophysiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.
 Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral disease that occurs over wide areas of Europe and Asia.
 Hantaviruses are the cause of this syndrome.
 The hallmark of HFRS is the triad of fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure.
 In its severe form it is associated with significant mortality.
 The syndrome evolves through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent.
 The central physiologic derangement in HFRS is vascular dysfunction, manifested by impaired vascular tone and increased vascular permeability.
 The systemic effects of this dysfunction account for the occurrence of hypotension and shock, while local effects are probably important in the development of renal failure.
 Shock in HFRS has distributive and oligemic features, while renal failure has features of acute tubular necrosis.
 Hemorrhage is a consequence of vascular injury and a deficit of functional platelets.
 Vascular and platelet dysfunction are both compounded by uremia.
 Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to hemorrhage in some patients.
 Although hantaviruses are infectious for endothelial cells and may cause direct injury, a large body of evidence suggests that immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS.

"Effect of stable xenon on regional cerebral blood flow and the electroencephalogram in normal volunteers.
 We evaluated the effects of breathing 35% stable xenon in 65% oxygen on regional cerebral blood flow and the electroencephalogram in 20 normal volunteers.
 We measured blood flow in 32 brain regions over both hemispheres with the xenon-133 intravenous injection technique in two protocols.
 In the first protocol (n = 10), a baseline study was followed by a second study during 5 minutes of breathing stable xenon; in the other protocol (n = 8), the baseline study was followed by a second study after 5 minutes of breathing stable xenon.
 Two volunteers were excluded due to excessive movements during the inhalation of stable xenon.
 Some of the remaining 18 volunteers had varying alterations of consciousness accompanied by electroencephalogram changes.
 After stable xenon inhalation the electroencephalogram returned to normal within 2-3 minutes.
 During stable xenon inhalation mean +/- SD PECO2 dropped significantly from 39.4 +/- 4.4 to 33.3 +/- 5.4 mm Hg in the first protocol and from 39.4 +/- 2.6 to 34.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg in the second protocol due to hyperventilation in 13 volunteers.
 Mean regional cerebral blood flow increased significantly by 13.5-25.4% without correction for PECO2.
 In the first protocol regional cerebral blood flow increased by greater than 12% in 11-14 (depending on the flow parameter) of the 20 hemispheres.
 In the second protocol regional cerebral blood flow increased by greater than 12% in 9-13 of the 16 hemispheres.
 We conclude that cautious interpretation is necessary in the assessment of regional cerebral blood flow with 35% xenon-enhanced computed tomography.

"The epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection in young children: comparison of findings from several developing countries. Coordinated Data Group of BOSTID Researchers.
 Investigators from 10 countries studied the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) among children 0-59 months old.
 Data on incidence rates, by age, gender, and season; on pathogenic agents; on case-fatality rates; and on selected risk factor findings are presented.
 Incidence rates from six of the community-based studies ranged from 12.7 to 16.8 new episodes of ARI per 100 child-weeks at risk, and rates of lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) ranged from 0.2 to 3.4 new episodes per 100 child-weeks at risk.
 Children spend from 21.7% to 40.1% of observed weeks with ARI and from 1% to 14.4% of observed weeks with LRI.
 The incidence rates for ARI are highest in younger children.
 Viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus, are isolated more frequently than bacteria from children with episodes of LRI.
 Risk factors exhibited different patterns of association with ARI in different studies.
 Interventions could have great impact on high-risk levels common in the study populations.

"Perfusion redistribution after alveolar flooding: vasoconstriction vs. vascular compression.
 We compared the effects of left caudal lobe (LCL) alveolar hypoxia on regional pulmonary blood flow (PBF) with the effects due to alveolar edema induced by plasma instilled directly into the LCL airways of 16 dogs.
 Regional measurements were made with positron emission tomography.
 After hypoxic ventilation of the LCL (n = 11), the LCL-to-right caudal lobe (L/R) PBF ratio fell from 0.94 +/- 0.21 during 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL to 0.46 +/- 0.21 (P less than 0.05).
 After instillation of either isooncotic (n = 5) or hypooncotic plasma (n = 3) into the LCL, the L/R PBF ratio was similar to that during LCL hypoxia (0.50 +/- 0.27 and 0.64 +/- 0.10, respectively, P less than 0.05 compared with 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL before plasma instillation).
 The changes in regional PBF due to LCL hypoxia and plasma instillation could be completely prevented (n = 8) by the prior administration of a single dose of endotoxin (15 micrograms/kg iv).
 In contrast to previous work, these results indicate that perfusion redistribution occurs regardless of the oncotic state of alveolar edema.
 More importantly, any change that does occur in regional PBF can be completely prevented by blocking regional vasoconstriction, indicating that mechanical compression cannot be the major factor determining the regional response of PBF to alveolar flooding.

"Reversal of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease by inspiratory assistance with a face mask.
 BACKGROUND.
 Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation.
 We designed, and here report on the efficacy of, a noninvasive ventilatory-assistance apparatus to provide inspiratory-pressure support by means of a face mask.
 METHODS.
 We assessed the short-term (45-minute) physiologic effects of the apparatus in 11 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in 13 such patients (including 3 of the 11 in the physiologic study) who were treated for several days and compared with 13 matched historical-control patients.
 RESULTS.
 In the physiologic study, after 45 minutes of inspiratory positive airway pressure by face mask, the mean (+/- SD) arterial pH rose from 7.31 +/- 0.08 to 7.38 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.01), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide fell from 68 +/- 17 mm Hg to 55 +/- 15 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and the partial pressure of oxygen rose from 52 +/- 12 mm Hg to 69 +/- 16 mm Hg (P less than 0.05).
 These changes were accompanied by marked reductions in respiratory rate (from 31 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 9 breaths per minute, P less than 0.01).
 Only 1 of the 13 patients treated with inspiratory positive airway pressure needed tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as compared with 11 of the 13 historical controls (P less than 0.001).
 Two patients in each group died.
 As compared with the controls, the treated patients had a more transient need for ventilatory assistance (3 +/- 1 vs.

"Improved neonatal survival following multiple doses of bovine surfactant in very premature neonates at risk for respiratory distress syndrome.
 To determine whether multiple doses of bovine surfactant would improve neonatal mortality in very premature neonates, we conducted two multicenter controlled trials under identical protocols; the results were combined for analysis.
 Four hundred and thirty neonates born between 23 and 29 weeks gestation and weighing 600 to 1250 g at birth were assigned randomly at birth to receive either 100 mg of phospholipids/kg of Survanta, a modified bovine surfactant (n = 210), or a sham air placebo (n = 220) within 15 minutes of birth.
 Neonates who developed respiratory distress syndrome and required mechanical ventilation with at least 30% oxygen could be given up to three more doses in the first 48 hours after birth.
 Dosing was performed by investigators not involved in the clinical care of the neonates; nursery staff were kept blinded as to the treatment assignment.
 Cause of death was determined by a panel of three independent, board-certified neonatologists after blindly reviewing case report forms and autopsy reports.
 Fewer Survanta-treated neonates died of any cause (11.4% vs 18.8%, P = .031), died of respiratory distress syndrome (1.9% vs 15.6%, P less than .001), and either died or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to respiratory distress syndrome (39.5% vs 49.1%, P = .044).
 The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was also lower in Survanta-treated neonates (28.0% vs 56.9%, P less than .001), and the Survanta-treated neonates' oxygenation and ventilatory status were improved significantly at 72 hours.
 Survanta-treated neonates were also at lowered risk of developing pulmonary interstitial emphysema (23.3% vs 36.9%, P = .002) and other forms of pulmonary air leaks (9.6% vs 20.8%, P .002).

"Chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease: diagnostic value of chest radiography and high-resolution CT.
 The diagnostic value of chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) in chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease (CDILD) was assessed in 140 consecutive patients with diffuse infiltration of the lung visible at radiography.
 Radiographs and CT scans were separately read by three independent observers without knowledge of clinical and pathologic data.
 The observers listed the three most likely diagnoses and recorded the degree of confidence they had in their choice on a 0%-100% probability scale.
 Findings at radiography and high-resolution CT were recorded by each observer and were used for a stepwise discriminant analysis between diagnoses.
 First-choice diagnoses of all three observers that were made with a high level of confidence (probability, greater than or equal to 75%) were more accurate with CT than with radiography (P less than .001).
 The superiority of high-resolution CT over radiography was most obvious for histiocytosis X and sarcoidosis; in cases of pulmonary fibrosis, CT was not significantly different from radiography.
 The interobserver agreement for the proposed diagnosis was significantly better with high-resolution CT (P less than .001).
 Twenty-one of 26 radiographic findings and 21 of 25 CT findings were discriminant.
 Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed the superiority of CT over radiography, since the ranking of all findings showed that the four most discriminant findings, and eight of the first 12 findings, were revealed with CT.

"Pathogenesis and sequelae of respiratory infections.
 Bacterial pneumonia remains a major health threat, with particular risk for infants in developing countries.
 The effective design of strategies that minimize the morbidity and mortality from pneumonia requires an awareness of the host defense mechanisms that function to prevent respiratory infections.
 In this review the normal immune host defenses and the abnormalities in this process that promote the development of lower respiratory bacterial infections will be briefly reviewed.
 A brief discussion will focus on a complication of respiratory infections, asthma, which can follow viral illness and also be a significant problem for children.

"The normal range of diurnal changes in peak expiratory flow rates. Relationship to symptoms and respiratory disease.
 Measuring peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) several times a day can provide an objective assessment of functional changes relative to environmental or occupational exposures.
 This report describes the pattern of diurnal changes in PEFR in a reference population, and defines ranges of ""normal"" between- and within-day variability.
 An index of diurnal changes was defined as the ratio between maximal and minimal values, where the maximal value was restricted to PEFR measured at noon or in the evening (N, E) and the minimal value was restricted to the morning or at bedtime (M, B).
 A ratio greater than normal represented an exaggeration of the normal diurnal pattern in PEFR.
 Normal limits, based on the ninety-fifth percentile in the reference population, were larger for children (130%) than for adults 15 to 35 yr of age (117%) and those older than 35 yr of age (118%).
 The meaningfulness of excessive diurnal changes in PEFR was examined by relating this ratio (Max/Min), and a similar measure (the amplitude percent mean) to chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases in 938 adults and children who recorded PEFR values 2 to 4 times per day for as long as 14 days.
 There was a strong relationship of diurnal changes in PEFR that exceed normal limits with physician-confirmed asthma (relative risk of 2.99 with Max/Min), with exertional dyspnea (Grade 2+), and with more frequent reporting of acute symptoms of wheeze, attacks of wheezing dyspnea, cough, and chest colds.
 In addition, those exceeding the normal limits had about 2.9 times greater risk of having a FEV1 below 80% of predicted, and nearly 7 times greater risk of being below 70%.

"Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia associated with profound lymphopenia and abnormal T-lymphocyte subset ratios during treatment for early-stage breast carcinoma.
 Two women with Stage II breast carcinoma treated with lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.
 Neither woman had evidence of immunosuppression before therapy.
 They both had profound lymphopenia, reversed CD4/CD8 ratios, and normal peripheral blood total leukocyte counts at the time of their infections.
 Both women were seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and had no risk factors for such an infection.
 The patients' CD4 lymphocyte counts increased after chemotherapy for breast carcinoma was discontinued.
 Thus, it appears that the therapy they received may have caused severe T-lymphocyte mediated immunosuppression.

"Antibiotic prophylaxis of respiratory tract infection in mechanically ventilated patients. A prospective, blinded, randomized trial of the effect of a novel regimen.
 The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a novel regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in patients requiring prolonged (at least five days) mechanical ventilation.
 The design was a controlled, prospective, randomized trial, with blinded comparison of the groups regarding the incidence of respiratory tract infection in an intensive care unit of a university hospital.
 After determination of the APACHE II score for severity of disease, 88 patients were randomly divided in three groups.
 Twenty-four of these patients did not complete five days of mechanical ventilation, and eight were withdrawn for other reasons.
 Fifty-six patients (18 in group 1, 21 in group 2, 17 in group 3) completed the study.
 Patients in both control groups 1 and 2 did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis, but the two groups differed in the antibiotic policy in case of infection.
 Patients in group 3 received antibiotic prophylaxis consisting of norfloxacin, polymyxin E, and amphotericin B, applied topically in oropharynx and stomach from time of ICU admission until extubation, and intravenous cefotaxime 500 mg three times a day during the first five days of admission.
 In both control groups, about 90 percent of the patients acquired microbial colonization of oropharynx or stomach.
 In group 3, only 12 percent and 24 percent of the patients acquired colonization of oropharynx and stomach, respectively (p less than 0.001).
 This resulted in a reduction of the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection (78 percent in group 1, 62 percent in group 2, 6 percent in group 3 [p = 0.0001]).
 The regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis studied prevented respiratory tract infection in mechanically ventilated patients.
 Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in all patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

"Chronic persistent cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux.
 Chronic cough persisting for two months or more that remains unexplained after extensive investigations is a common clinical problem.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux.
 Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified.
 All were non-smokers.
 The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months.
 Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough.
 All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring.
 A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0.
 Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index.
 The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes).
 Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes.
 It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux.
 It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation.
 Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted.

"Mohs micrographic surgery fixed-tissue technique for melanoma of the nose.
 Mohs micrographic surgery, fixed-tissue technique, for excision of nasal melanoma provides three important benefits: 1) assurance of eradication of the main mass along with its ""silent"" contiguous outgrowths, 2) safe management of non-contiguous satellites too small to be visible initially, and 3) safe sparing of maximal amounts of surrounding normal tissues.
 These benefits are achieved because all incisions are through chemically fixed (killed) tissue, eliminating the danger of disseminating the highly transplantable melanoma cells and permitting the excision of successive layers for microscopic scanning of their undersurfaces by the systematic use of frozen sections.
 The process is continued to the termination of each ramification.
 There is no need to remove a wide margin of normal tissue as is customary with conventional surgery.
 Clinically invisible satellites are not moved or disturbed and can be removed safely by the same method if they appear.
 The reliability of the method is manifested by the 62.5% 5-year cure in a series of 10 consecutive patients, all of whom had no local recurrence after micrographic surgery.

"Effect of endotoxin and a burn injury on lung and liver lipid peroxidation and catalase activity.
 Both endotoxin and a burn alone produce oxidant-induced tissue lipid peroxidation.
 The endotoxin response is due in large part to hydrogen peroxide.
 The combination of endotoxin after a burn results in an increased liver, but not lung, oxidant injury.
 Our purpose was to determine whether the burn oxidant injury inactivated endogenous liver tissue catalase, thereby amplifying a subsequent H2O2 insult.
 Twenty-six adult sheep were studied.
 Twelve sheep had a 15% TBS burn.
 Tissue catalase activity, measured in lung and liver 3 days postburn, was significantly decreased from a control of 3.58 +/- 1.8 and 193 +/- 63, respectively, to 1.72 +/- 0.63 and 148 +/- 33 k(sec-1)/0.5 gram tissue.
 The addition of endotoxin 3 days postburn resulted in an increase in liver malondialdehyde, MDA, a measure of lipid peroxidation, from a control of 110 +/- 80 to 450 +/- 54 nmol/gram tissue.
 This value was significantly greater than the 210 +/- 80 nmol/gram tissue seen after endotoxin alone.
 Lung tissue MDA with burn and endotoxin was 65 +/- 8 compared to 42 +/- 7 for control and 80 +/- 6 nmol/gram for endotoxin alone.
 We conclude that a decrease in liver catalase activity occurs after a burn.
 The decrease corresponds to an accentuated oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation after an added endotoxin insult where H2O2 is known to be an etiologic agent.
 The catalase activity also decreases in postburn lung, but accentuated lung damage was not seen, indicating a variable tissue response from the burn-induced decrease in antioxidant activity.

"The rat lung organotypic culture: an in vitro model for studying surfactant metabolism abnormalities.
 The amount of surfactant present in the intra-alveolar space is mainly regulated by the synthesis and recycling of surfactant by type II pneumocytes.
 Biochemical analyses have shown that the surfactant level is frequently diminished and that protein-rich exudate can further interfere with surfactant function in the lungs of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients.
 The microenvironmental changes that occur in the alveoli of burned patients, who are prone to developing ARDS, are unclear.
 Therefore, using an in vitro rat lung organotypic culture, we showed that the sera of rats with a 3-day old, third-degree thermal injury (25-30% total body surface area) inhibited surfactant synthesis in organotypically cultured rat lung cells.
 Surfactant precursor, 3H-choline, incorporation into the surfactant was 58% of control.
 Using liposomes made of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol (8:1, v/v) or surfactant we showed that surfactant endocytosis by purified type II alveolar cells is an active, temperature-dependent process, and correlates with the quantity of surfactant present in the milieu.
 We also found that plasma protein-rich fluid interfered with surfactant endocytosis by the purified type II pneumocytes.
 These two processes of inhibition of surfactant synthesis and its reutilization by these cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS.

"Lymphokine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in the rat.
 We evaluated the potential role of the lymphocyte in chronic airway inflammation and responsiveness by repeated administration to rats of interleukin-2 (IL-2), the principal lymphokine responsible for lymphocyte proliferation.
 Lewis rats (mean weight, 184 +/- 2 g) received either 120,000 units of IL-2 (n = 10) or vehicle (n = 7) subcutaneously twice a day for 4.5 days.
 Animals were anesthetized with urethane and intubated for measurements of pulmonary resistance (RL) and airway responsiveness to aerosol methacholine (MCh).
 Lung lavage was performed, the animals were exsanguinated, and the lungs were fixed in 10% formalin.
 Histologic edema and the extent of infiltration of the bronchi, pulmonary veins, and arteries by cells was scored blindly.
 IL-2 increased airway responsiveness to MCh; the concentrations of MCh causing a doubling of RL were 0.14 versus 1.39 mg/ml (geometric mean) for the IL-2 and vehicle group, respectively (p = 0.001).
 IL-2 significantly increased total cellular return and the percentage of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils in lavage.
 IL-2 caused edema and a mixed cellular infiltration of the bronchovascular tree.
 Lymphocytes predominated around the airways and veins.
 A correlation (r = 0.50) was present between airway responsiveness and airway inflammation but not with edema or vascular infiltration.
 Release of IL-2 by lymphocytes in the airways may be an important mediator of airway hyperresponsiveness.

"Retrospective analysis of the incidence of pulmonary disease in hypogammaglobulinemia.
 To determine the best predictors of chronic pulmonary disease in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, we evaluated the clinical records, chest x-ray films, and pulmonary function tests of 10 patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) followed for a mean of 12.5 years, and 12 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) followed for a mean of 10.5 years.
 These patients, most of whom were treated with intramuscular gamma globulin and long-term oral antibiotics, had very few pneumonias after diagnosis.
 The patients with XLA had 0.10 pneumonias per treatment year, and the patients with CVID had 0.18 pneumonias per treatment year.
 Seven of the 10 patients with XLA had normal chest x-ray films 8 to 15 years after diagnosis, and none had bronchiectasis.
 Pulmonary disease was more common and more severe in the group with CVID, but five patients in this group also had normal chest x-ray films after long follow-up.
 In the entire group of 22 patients, nine of the 10 patients with abnormal chest x-ray films on most recent evaluation already had pulmonary disease at the initial visit (p = 0.00002).
 These studies indicate that the best predictors of good pulmonary function in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are early diagnosis and good compliance with gamma globulin replacement therapy and oral antibiotics.

"Biologic and protective properties of the 69-kDa outer membrane protein of Bordetella pertussis: a novel formulation for an acellular pertussis vaccine.
 A combination of the 69-kDa outer membrane protein and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), both isolated from lymphocytosis promoting factor (LPF; pertussis toxin) minus mutants of Bordetella pertussis, is protective in the mouse intracerebral challenge potency (Kendrick) test.
 A combination of the same 69-kDa protein and LPF is approximately 15 times less effective.
 These data suggest that, surprisingly, the 69-kDa protein in tandem with FHA is the most relevant combination for mouse protection; consequently such a combination may be a more suitable acellular pertussis vaccine candidate than the LPF/FHA combinations, which have never been satisfactorily protective in the mouse test.
 Preparation of samples of the 69-kDa protein of acceptable protective quality remains difficult.
 Attempts were made to screen the most suitable batches of the preparations by exploiting some recently discovered properties of the 69-kDa protein: the characteristic chromatofocusing pattern of the protein, the affinity for lymphocytes, and the ability to bind to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
 None of these tests was able to replace the mouse intracerebral challenge potency test for final quality assessment.

"Value of antigen detection in predicting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis 
 Two ELISAs were used to detect serum and urinary aspergillus antigen in 121 patients who were profoundly neutropenic after leukaemia therapy or bone marrow transplantation.
 The presence of antigen correctly predicted development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in 16 patients.
 In 2 other cases antigen appeared after the clinical diagnosis had been made, while in only 1 case was antigen not detected.
 In 11 of 13 episodes of clinically suspected fungal infection antigen was detected before clinical diagnosis was made.
 By contrast, antigen was detected in only 1 of 90 patients who had no evidence of IPA.
 Both ELISAs gave positive and negative predictive values for IPA of greater than 95%, demonstrating the value of antigen detection in early diagnosis of aspergillus infection and the assay's ability to predict subsequent development of IPA.
 We conclude that neutropenic patients should be screened for aspergillus antigen, and propose that initial detection of fungal antigen justifies commencement of empirical antifungal therapy.
 Such an approach should improve the survival of patients who are at risk of developing this usually fatal infection.

"A 19-year follow-up of tuberculin reactors. Assessment of skin test reactivity and in vitro lymphocyte responses.
 Tuberculin skin test reactivity decreases with time such that repeat PPD skin testing may result in reactions of less than 10 mm.
 This reactivity may be boosted in some individuals with a second tuberculin skin test.
 The immunologic basis of these observations remains unclear.
 We studied the relationship between skin-test reactivity and in vitro blastogenic response to PPD in a cohort of 22 individuals (aged 28 to 81 years) known to be tuberculin reactors (induration greater than or equal to 10 mm) in 1970.
 In 1989, 18 subjects remained reactive to PPD on the first skin test and responded to PPD in vitro (mean incorporation of 3H-thymidine by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 22,650 cpm).
 Three subjects reverted (induration in response to PPD less than 10 mm) and lost in vitro reactivity to PPD (mean incorporation of 3H-thymidine, 2,205 cpm).
 One subject boosted (increase of induration of at least 6 mm to greater than or equal to 15 mm) on the second skin test and showed a concomitant in vitro boost in the blastogenic response to PPD (from 1,008 cpm to 47,837 cpm).
 In this cohort, interpretation of the two-step tuberculin skin test correlated closely with in vitro proliferative responses.
 Over a 19-year period, the majority of individuals maintained skin test reactivity and strong in vitro responses to PPD despite a lack of ongoing exogenous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 The immunologic basis for reversion appears to depend in part on a loss of lymphocyte blastogenic capacity.
 In the one individual who exhibited the booster phenomenon, repeat antigen stimulation resulted in a dramatic increase in the in vitro blastogenic responses.

"A hospital-based study of acute viral infections of the respiratory tract in Thai children, with emphasis on laboratory diagnosis.
 The hospital-based study described here examined the viruses found in 738 children less than 5 years old who presented at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from January 1986 to December 1987 with acute respiratory tract infections.
 Three methods for detection of viral infection are compared: direct examination of epithelial cells of the respiratory tract with the use of fluorescent antibody staining, isolation of virus, and measurement of antibody in acute- and convalescent-phase sera.
 Viral infections were found in 44.7% of the study population.
 Diagnosis by the examination of epithelial cells with the fluorescent antibody staining procedure was found to have several deficiencies; however, this technique was the most sensitive for diagnosis of infection due to respiratory syncytial virus.
 Isolation of virus was the best method for identification of adenoviruses, parainfluenza 1 and 3 viruses, and influenza B virus.
 Problems associated with serodiagnosis included failure to obtain specimens of convalescent-phase blood in 24.5% of cases and insensitivity of serodiagnosis for young children except for the identification of antibody to influenza A virus.
 The combination of all three tests yielded the best rate of detection of virus.

"Use of a biotinylated DNA probe specific for the human Y chromosome in the evaluation of the allograft lung.
 A cloned 3.4 kilobase DNA probe derived from the heterochromatin of the Y chromosome was used to investigate the regeneration and reepithelialization of allograft lungs of nine recipients who received sex mismatched donor organs.
 Patients were monitored for varying periods of time, up to four years, by transbronchial biopsy.
 In situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded biopsies utilizing the Y probe revealed that bronchial and alveolar epithelium and arterial and venous endothelium of the peripheral lung retained a donor phenotype, irrespective of episodes of acute or chronic rejection (obliterative bronchiolitis) which are known to injure these cellular subsets.
 In contrast, migratory cells, lymphocytes and macrophages, gradually, at varying rates, infiltrated the allografted lungs, replacing preexisting donor elements.
 Cases of active OB were manifested by infiltration of bronchioles by sex-mismatched lymphocytes; however, in some instances, quiescent recipient lymphocytes colonized the allograft and were unassociated with histologic rejection.
 Macrophages of similar sex seemed to cluster together within air spaces.
 Use of a DNA probe for the Y chromosome and in situ hybridization techniques allow monitoring of cellular alterations over time in recipients with sex mismatched allografts.

 In this review, the epidemiologic data from developing nations for these viral infections are summarized and the current status of viral vaccines for prevention of ALRI are described.
 Among the questions to be addressed before these vaccines are used in developing nations are (1) the age-specific rates of infection and disease, (2) the effect of high-dose early exposure to these viruses, and (3) the effect of malnutrition on the immunogenicity of the vaccines.

 For the other 14 mediastinitis patients, who were not exposed to the resident, a preoperative albumin level of less than 3.0 g/dl was also a risk factor (8/14 cases vs.
 8/43 controls, P less than .009).
 Thus, this study suggests that it is important to follow MRSA disseminators and to recognize that preoperative serum albumin levels are a risk factor for mediastinitis.

"Effect of radiation therapy on thoracic and lumbar bone marrow: evaluation with MR imaging.
 Bone marrow suppression is often the limiting factor in the use of radiation therapy.
 In order to determine if MR imaging can be used to quantify bone marrow changes, we performed a serial prospective study of patients with lung cancer (six cases) and lymphoma (six cases).
 Quantitative and qualitative assessments of T1-weighted sagittal images, 750/33 (TR/TE), obtained at 0.6 T before, during, and after radiotherapy showed increased signal intensity in the radiated portions of the spine.
 These changes appeared as early as 2 weeks after the beginning of radiation, continued to increase until a maximum value was attained, and then persisted during the follow-up period of 2 years.
 A significantly higher (p less than .04) ratio of pretreatment to maximum posttreatment signal intensity was seen in patients with lymphoma than in those with lung cancer, and pretreatment values in patients with lymphoma were significantly lower (p less than .01).
 The lower pretreatment values found in the patients with lymphoma may have been due to the smaller amount of yellow marrow in these patients, who were significantly younger (33 vs 62 years).
 The higher ratio of pre- and posttreatment signal intensity may have been related to the larger amount of hematopoietic marrow available to undergo fatty replacement.
 The persistence of elevated signal intensity for as long as 2 years after radiation suggests an endpoint in the process of marrow conversion, but not reversal in the form of regeneration of hematopoietic bone marrow.
 Quantitative MR evaluation of bone marrow may be of considerable value as a noninvasive means of monitoring the effects of radiotherapy.

"A longitudinal study of respiratory symptoms in a community population sample. Correlations with smoking, allergen skin-test reactivity, and serum IgE 
 Chronic cough and/or phlegm, wheeze in the absence of colds, and rhinitis attributed to allergies are three of the most common respiratory symptoms encountered in community populations.
 In this study, we have determined the prevalence of these complaints in a random population sample (n = 1,109) using standardized questionnaires at two points in time, eight years apart.
 Cross-sectional prevalence and changes in symptom occurrence have been correlated with smoking status, allergen skin test reactivity, and total serum IgE levels.
 Our objective was to determine the individual and combined influence of these three variables on symptom prevalence.
 Initially, 19.2 percent of the population admitted to wheeze, 17.9 percent to cough, and 44.1 percent to allergic rhinitis.
 Cough and wheeze prevalence changed little over the eight-year period, while rhinitis increased 11 percent by the second survey.
 The occurrence of chronic cough was strongly correlated with smoking, and was not further influenced by either allergen skin reactivity or IgE level.
 Conversely, rhinitis prevalence was related to skin test reactivity with no additional association with smoking or IgE level.
 The occurrence of wheeze in the absence of colds was associated with both smoking and allergen skin reactivity.
 Among smokers, the prevalence was over 30 percent and was similar in both skin test positive (STP) and skin test negative (STN) individuals.
 However, on both surveys, STP ex-smokers and nonsmokers had significantly more wheeze than those who were STN.
 While the prevalence of wheeze in STN nonsmokers was low (6.8 percent), an IgE-wheeze relationship was also suggested on the second survey.
 In addition to these cross-sectional symptom relationships, changes in either smoking status or allergen skin reactivity during the study period were associated with changes in the prevalence of each symptom.

"Norepinephrine and phenylephrine effects on right ventricular function in experimental canine pulmonary embolism.
 In a canine model of pulmonary embolism (PE) produced by infusion of autologous blood clots, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased to 73 +/- 4 mm Hg while cardiac output (CO) decreased to less than 50 percent of baseline.
 Intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PHEN) and norepinephrine (NE) restored MAP to somewhat above baseline values.
 However, only NE restored CO to control levels.
 The right ventricular myocardial blood flow increased 15 percent in the PE group with PHEN and 229 percent with NE at equipressor concentrations.
 The right ventricular myocardial oxygen consumption (RVMVo2) was not significantly different between PE and PE + PHEN while PE + NE increased RVMVO2 by 144 percent to 20.2 +/- 1.8 ml/min/100 g.
 The RV output was not adequately restored with PE, but when RV contractility was augmented with NE, RV output was restored to baseline.
 Right ventricular minute work increased 100 percent with NE and was maintained with a 100 percent increase in oxygen consumption.
 Calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was decreased during PE by 36 percent with PE + PHEN while PVR in NE-treated dogs decreased by 59 percent.
 In NE-treated animals, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was restored to control levels while in PHEN-treated animals SVR increased about 75 percent from baseline.
 We conclude that the salutary effects of NE on RV output are due to both alpha and beta receptor stimulation, which increased contractility, RVMBF, and RVMVo2, and decreased both PVR and SVR.
 In the PHEN-treated dogs, our indices of minute-work, RVMBF, and RVMVo2 suggest that coronary autoregulation was intact; however, there was no apparent benefit to RV output.
 This study suggests that in the clinical setting of acute PE, the judicious use of NE, rather than PHEN, may be more beneficial in restoring RV function and systemic hemodynamics.

"A population-based perspective of the hospital incidence and case-fatality rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The Worcester DVT Study.
 A community-wide study was conducted in 16 short-stay hospitals in metropolitan Worcester, Mass, to examine the incidence and case-fatality rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients hospitalized between July 1, 1985, and December 31, 1986.
 The average annual incidence of deep vein thrombosis alone was 48 per 100,000, while the incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis was 23 per 100,000.
 The incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism increased exponentially with age.
 The in-hospital case-fatality rate of venous thromboembolism was 12%.
 Among patients discharged from the hospital, the long-term case-fatality rates were 19%, 25%, and 30% at 1, 2, and 3 years after hospital discharge.
 Extrapolation of the data from this population-based study suggests that there are approximately 170,000 new cases of clinically recognized venous thromboembolism in patients treated in short-stay hospitals in the United States each year, and 99,000 hospitalizations for recurrent disease.
 Because of the silent nature of this disease and the low rate of autopsy in the United States, the total incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of venous thromboembolism remain elusive.

 The nature of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in hospitalized children and of the associated viral agents was assessed in a study of 601 children less than 5 years old over a 24-month period.
 Of these children, 80% were less than 24 months of age and the ratio of boys to girls was 1.7:1.
 Pneumonia (86.5% of cases) was the most frequently observed clinical manifestation.
 Shedding of virus was detected in 21.1% of the children; the highest rate occurred in infants 0-5 months old (27%) as compared with a rate of only 12.5% in children 25-60 months old.
 Virus was detected in 33.3%, 32.8%, 21.2%, and 20% of the cases of tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup, respectively.
 Among the viruses detected, 78% were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (91% of infections with this virus occurred in children less than 2 years old) and 14.4% were influenza virus types A and B.
 Of the RSV infections, 61% occurred in infants less than 1 year old.
 The case-fatality rate was 6.8% overall and was 4.8% in virus-associated cases.

"Changes in self-concept during pulmonary rehabilitation, Part 1.
 The purpose of this two-part study was to describe changes in self-concept during and after a formal pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 A 20-item semantic meaning differential scale was administered to 37 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were participating in a multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 Patients were asked to evaluate their past, present, and future selves on program admission, on program discharge, and 2 to 6 months after home discharge.
 Mean total self-concept score for the present self significantly increased between program admission and home discharge 3 weeks later (mean change 31.32 +/- 22.04, p less than 0.0001).
 No significant declines in self-concept were found 2 to 6 months after home discharge (p = 0.39).
 Men showed a significantly higher change in total self-concept score than women during the 3-week program (p = 0.03).
 However, the men's change score dropped significantly after home discharge (p = 0.02), suggesting a need for more intensive follow-up care than with women.
 The self-concept tool in this study provided an easy way to monitor subjective changes in psychologic status.

"Suppression of ventilatory muscle activity in healthy subjects and COPD patients with negative pressure ventilation.
 We evaluated the ability of NPV to suppress EMGd and EMGint in seven patients with severe COPD and five normal subjects.
 Subjects were studied either without (A) or with mouthpiece and nose clip (B).
 Electromyographic suppression was assessed comparing EMG activity during NPV with the control activity without a mouthpiece and prior to the initiation of the NPV run.
 In normal subjects, in A, NPV resulted in a partial suppression of EMGd; in B, prior to NPV, EMGd rose compared with A prior to NPV.
 In patients, in A, NPV resulted in a suppression of both EMGd and EMGint.
 In B, prior to NPV, both EMGd and EMGint rose compared with A prior to NPV.
 Thus, it seems that NPV is able to produce a consistent reduction in inspiratory muscle EMG activity.
 This variable NPV ability would have to be assessed for better selection criteria for patient candidates in a rehabilitation program.

"Exercise but not methacholine differentiates asthma from chronic lung disease in children.
 Bronchial provocation challenges with exercise and methacholine were performed on the same day or within a short interval in 52 children with asthma, 22 with other types of chronic lung disease (including cystic fibrosis), and 19 control subjects with no evidence of chronic lung disease.
 There were no significant differences in the baseline lung function before the two types of challenge in the individual groups and differences between the patients with asthma and with chronic lung disease were minor.
 When the mean -2 SD of the methacholine response of the control group was taken as the lower limit of normal, 49/52 (94%) patients with asthma and 18/22 (82%) with chronic lung disease responded abnormally.
 In contrast, with the mean +2 SD of the exercise response of the control group as the upper limit of normal, 41/52 (79%) asthmatic patients responded but none of those with chronic lung disease.
 Thus the response to the two types of challenge helps to distinguish asthma from other types of chronic lung disease in children.

"Gcglobulin functions as a cochemotaxin in the lower respiratory tract. A potential mechanism for lung neutrophil recruitment in cigarette smokers.
 Activation of the complement pathway with generation of the potent chemotaxin C5a may play a significant role in the neutrophil accumulation seen in the lungs of patients with smoking-associated diseases.
 Although C5a is rapidly degraded to the less potent chemotaxin C5a des Arg, binding of this peptide with its cochemotaxin Gcglobulin (GcG) can restore its chemotactic potency.
 Therefore, modulation of Gcglobulin levels in smoking-induced lung disease could affect the accumulation of neutrophils seen in this disorder.
 To test this hypothesis GcG was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) obtained from non-smokers, asymptomatic smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 Antigenic amounts of GcG in BALF were increased in COPD patients and asymptomatic smokers compared with nonsmokers (6.35 +/- 1.02 and 5.15 +/- 1.07 versus 2.82 +/- 0.37 micrograms/mg albumin, p less than 0.05).
 In addition, we found that BALF enhanced C5a des Arg-mediated chemotaxis (48.3 +/- 5.6 versus 11.2 +/- 1.6 cells/high power field, p less than 0.05), an effect that was not seen in the presence of GcG antibody.
 Furthermore, BALF GcG was similar to serum GcG using Western blot analysis, and the interaction of GcG with C5a des Arg was not inhibited by cigarette smoke.
 These data demonstrate that elevation of BALF GcG levels occurs in smoking-associated lung disease and that this protein is biologically active and capable of increasing C5a des Arg-mediated chemotaxis.
 This suggests that modulation of GcG levels may be important in smoking-associated lung diseases.

"Pneumothorax in AIDS 
 OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for the development of pneumothorax in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
 SETTING: Tertiary care center.
 PATIENTS: Of 1030 patients with AIDS who were followed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1 January 1980 and 30 September 1989, 20 (2%) developed pneumothorax that was unrelated to trauma or a pulmonary procedure.
 RESULTS: Of 20 patients with AIDS who presented with pneumothorax, 19 had compelling evidence of concurrent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 Using bivariate analysis, patients receiving aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis (relative risk, 17.6) and those with a history of P.
 carinii pneumonia (relative risk, 14.5) were more likely to develop pneumothorax.
 By Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis, aerosol pentamidine use was a statistically significant risk factor independent of a history of P.
 carinii pneumonia.
 The pneumothorax-related mortality rate was 10% and there was considerable morbidity.
 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIDS at the highest risk for developing pneumothorax are those with a history of P.
 carinii pneumonia who are receiving aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis but who nevertheless develop P.
 carinii pneumonia.
 The benefits of aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis in these patients far outweigh this risk.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be considered as the most likely diagnosis in any patient with AIDS who develops a pneumothorax.

"Neonatal complications at term as related to the degree of umbilical artery acidemia.
 The degree of umbilical arterial acidemia associated with immediate newborn morbidity has not been determined.
 Therefore we compared 358 term infants with umbilical artery acidemia (pH less than 7.20) with 358 term, nonacidotic matched control infants, to evaluate immediate neonatal complications in both groups.
 Nonacidotic was defined as an umbilical artery pH greater than or equal to 7.20.
 Complications included seizures, persistent hypotonia, and/or signs of end-organ damage such as renal or cardiac dysfunction.
 None of the 693 newborns with an umbilical artery pH greater than or equal to 7.00 had such complications.
 Two of 23 infants with an umbilical artery pH less than 7.00 had sequelae related to intrapartum asphyxia.

"Surgery in patients on long-term steroid therapy: a tentative model for risk assessment.
 Increased morbidity after operation has been associated with long-term steroid therapy.
 To determine the correlation between steroid therapy and such morbidity, the perioperative course of 55 steroid-treated patients was reviewed: 27 had bronchopulmonary disorders (group P) and 28 had non-pulmonary diseases (group NP).
 There were six (11 per cent) deaths, of which three were steroid related.
 Among the 13 non-lethal postoperative complications, eight were considered to be steroid related in group P and one in group NP.
 The duration of steroid therapy was for a median of 24 months (range 1-408 months) in group P and for a median of 6 months (range 1-240 months) in group NP (P less than 0.01).
 In contrast, the daily dose of hydrocortisone or equivalent before operation was significantly lower in group P, with a median of 0.51 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.20-2.56 mg kg-1 day-1) than in group NP, with a median of 1.20 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.23-7.38 mg kg-1 day-1) (P less than 0.01).
 In conclusion, bronchopulmonary disorders requiring a long duration of steroid therapy are associated with a higher risk of steroid-related complications after surgery.
 A convenient mathematical model is proposed which may allow a preoperative assessment of surgical risk, using steroid dose and duration of treatment.

"Measurement of maximal static respiratory pressures at the mouth with different air leaks.
 The effect of two different circuit leaks on the measurement of maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures at the mouth (Pimax, Pemax) was assessed in 70 patients with respiratory disease.
 Patients were divided into three groups with similar anthropometric and spirometric characteristics.
 The first group (30 patients) had their Pmax measured with a leak of 2.0 mm internal diameter (ID) and 37 mm length (as proposed by T.
 Ringqvist) and repeated with a second leak of 1.0 mm ID and 15 mm length (as recommended by J.
 L.
 Clausen).
 The two measurements were done in random order.
 Measurements for the other two groups (20 patients each) were taken with one or another, the two leaks randomly alternated with no leak.
 Pimax measurements obtained with Ringqvist's leak were 17 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with Clausen's leak and 22 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with no leak.
 Pemax measurements performed with Ringqvist's leak in place were 11 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with Clausen's leak and 11 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those obtained with no leak.
 The comparison between Clausen's leak and no leak showed no statistically significant difference.
 We conclude that whenever the effect of pressure generated in the mouth is to be avoided in the measurement of respiratory Pmax, a leak of the size proposed by Ringqvist is to be preferred.

 Conventional film radiography (FR) and six postprocessing algorithms of isodose storage phosphor digital radiography (SR) (0.2-mm X 10-bit pixel matrix) were compared in the evaluation of 40 mediastinal and 30 pulmonary lesions in 60 patients who underwent computed tomography of the chest.
 The six SR algorithms varied among each other in only one image parameter.
 One algorithm approximated conventional image characteristics.
 The other five algorithms were designed to optimize imaging of the mediastinum and tested the effects of gray-scale reversal, adjustment of optical density, a linear instead of a sigmoid gradation curve, and moderate edge enhancement of high and medium spatial frequencies.
 Performance was evaluated by calculating the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of 5,040 observations by six readers.

"Central neurogenic hyperventilation: pharmacologic intervention with morphine sulfate and correlative analysis of respiratory, sleep, and ocular motor dysfunction.
 Central neurogenic hyperventilation (CNH), for which there is no effective therapy, can eventually result in respiratory fatigue and death.
 This report describes a patient with CNH due to a brainstem anaplastic astrocytoma who also exhibited disturbances of sleep and ocular motor function.
 The CNH responded clinically to morphine sulfate and methadone.
 Analysis of ventilatory response to CO2 before and after morphine demonstrated a depression of ventilatory response (49 to 53% of baseline) and occlusion pressure response (35 to 50% of baseline) to CO2, with a requirement for high doses of naloxone (10 mg IV) to reverse the effect.
 Polysomnography revealed sustained hyperventilation, elevated O2 saturation, and low end-tidal CO2 throughout all stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and absence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
 Ocular motor evaluation disclosed absence of horizontal and reflexive saccades with compensatory head thrusts.
 Correlation of the clinical and physiologic data with the MRI abnormalities suggested that the lesion responsible for CNH in this patient might reside in the medial tegmental parapontine reticular formation.
 Since recurrent episodes of hyperventilation responded in a sustained fashion to IV and oral opiates, this treatment may warrant consideration in other patients with CNH.

"Interaction of chemical and high vascular pressure injury in isolated canine lung [published erratum appears in J Appl Physiol 1991 Mar;70(3):964]
 Because both chemical and mechanical insults to the lung may occur concomitantly with trauma, we hypothesized that the pressure threshold for vascular pressure-induced (mechanical) injury would be decreased after a chemical insult to the lung.
 Normal isolated canine lung lobes (N, n = 14) and those injured with either airway acid instillation (AAI, n = 18) or intravascular oleic acid (OA, n = 25) were exposed to short (5-min) periods of elevated venous pressure (HiPv) ranging from 19 to 130 cmH2O.
 Before the HiPv stress, the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) was 0.12 +/- 0.01, 0.27 +/- 0.03, and 0.31 +/- 0.02 ml.min-1.cmH2O-1 x 100 g-1 and the isogravimetric capillary pressure (Pc,i) was 9.2 +/- 0.3, 6.8 +/- 0.5, and 6.5 +/- 0.3 cmH2O in N, AAI, and OA lungs, respectively.
 However, the pattern of response to HiPv was similar in all groups: Kf,c was no different from the pre-HiPv value when the peak venous pressure (Pv) remained less than 55 cmH2O, but it increased reversibly when peak Pv exceeded 55 cmH2O (P less than 0.05).

"Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in surgical patients.
 Venous thromboembolic disease is a common, potentially life-threatening, but preventable complication of surgery.
 Venographic studies have shown a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients who do not receive prophylaxis.
 The long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis in these patients can be disabling, but the exact prevalence of post-thrombotic complications has not been well documented.
 Fatal pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0.5% to 1% of patients after major abdominal surgery and in 2% to 6% after total hip replacement.

"The destructive index and early lung destruction in smokers.
 The destructive index (DI), a measure of alveolar septal damage and emphysema, has been proposed as a sensitive index of lung destruction that closely reflects functional abnormalities, especially loss of elastic recoil.
 To better understand the progression of lung destruction in smokers, we studied the contribution of its principal components: breaks in the alveolar septa (DIb) and the presence of emphysematous spaces (DIe), and compared them to the mean linear intercept (Lm) and DI as originally described.
 To do this we employed lungs obtained at autopsy from non-smokers and smokers.
 Lungs were selected by emphysema score (ES) so that all cases were emphysema free (nonsmokers and seven smokers) or had minimal emphysema (nine smokers; ES = 5).
 Of these indices, only DIb was significantly increased in the lungs of smokers: 17.8 +/- 1.2 versus 12.4 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.05.
 We also investigated the regional distribution of destruction by comparing results in upper and lower lobes.
 DIe, but not DIb, was significantly increased in upper lobes of smokers.
 These data support the notion that increases in DI in the lungs of smokers that occur before increases in Lm or ES reflect the presence of alveolar septal breaks and highlight the importance of alveolar septal destruction as a precursor to the development of airspace enlargement in the lungs of cigarette smokers.

 Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis is a destructive, locally invasive process, with a propensity for local recurrence after inadequate excision.
 Although it does not metastasize, uncontrolled growth can eventually lead to death.
 The role for radiation and chemotherapy is controversial and these modalities are best reserved for advanced unresectable or recurrent lesions.
 The treatment of choice is en bloc surgical resection with wide margins.

"Parapneumonic empyema in children: decortication hastens recovery in patients with severe pleural infections.
 The medical records of 61 children 0 to 18 years of age treated for empyema complicating pneumonia from 1977 to 1989 were reviewed with attention to clinical presentation, bacteriology, treatment and outcome.
 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common infecting organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, other streptococcal species, anaerobes, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Eikenella corrodens.
 No organisms were recovered in 39% of patients.
 Twelve patients were treated successfully with antibiotics and thoracentesis alone, 23 patients underwent close tube thoracostomy and 26 required decortication.
 A thickened pleural ""peel,"" scoliosis and opacification of a hemithorax on chest radiograph, as well as low pleural pH and glucose concentration, were associated with a poor response to medical management.
 A scoring system was developed to define the severity of pleural disease.
 In patients with severe pleural infections, decortication allowed more rapid defervescence (2.2 vs.
 6.5 days) and earlier hospital discharge (4.4 vs.
 12.4 days) than did closed tube thoracostomy (P less than 0.001).

"Inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in the brain. Suppression of endothelial cell turnover by penicillamine and the depletion of copper, an angiogenic cofactor.
 Microvascular proliferation, a hallmark of malignant brain tumors, represents an attractive target of anticancer research, especially because of the quiescent nonproliferative endothelium of the normal brain.
 Cerebral neoplasms sequester copper, a trace metal that modulates angiogenesis.
 Using a rabbit brain tumor model, normocupremic animals developed large vascularized VX2 carcinomas.
 By contrast, small, circumscribed, relatively avascular tumors were found in the brains of rabbits copper-depleted by diet and penicillamine treatment (CDPT).
 The CDPT rabbits showed a significant decrease in serum copper, copper staining of tumor cell nuclei, microvascular density, the tumor volume, endothelial cell turnover, and an increase in the vascular permeability (breakdown of the blood-brain barrier), as well as peritumoral brain edema.
 In non-tumor-bearing animals, CDPT did not alter the vascular permeability or the brain water content.
 CDPT also inhibited the intracerebral growth of the 9L gliosarcoma in F-344 rats, with a similar increase of the peritumoral vascular permeability and the brain water content.
 CDPT failed to inhibit tumor growth and the vascularization of the VX2 carcinoma in the thigh muscle or the metastases to the lung, findings that may reflect regional differences in the responsiveness of the endothelium, the distribution of copper, or the activity of cuproenzymes.
 Metabolic and pharmacologic withdrawal of copper suppresses intracerebral tumor angiogenesis; angiosuppression is a novel biologic response modifier for the in situ control of tumor growth in the brain.

"Sphenochoanal polyps: evaluation with CT and MR imaging.
 A sphenochoanal polyp is a solitary mass of low attenuation on computed tomographic (CT) scans that arises from the sphenoid sinus and extends through the sphenoid ostium, across the sphenoethmoid recess, and into the choana (the boundary between the nasal cavity and nasopharynx).
 More often, however, a choanal polyp is an antrochoanal polyp, which arises from the maxillary antrum, protrudes through the middle meatus, extends into the nasal cavity, and continues back to the choana.
 Contiguous axial or coronal magnetic resonance and CT images help clearly differentiate the rare sphenochoanal polyp from the more common antrochoanal polyp.

"Tussive effect of a fentanyl bolus.
 The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of pre-induction coughing, after an iv bolus of fentanyl.
 The study sample was 250 ASA physical status I-II patients, scheduled for various elective surgical procedures.
 The first 100 were randomly allocated to receive 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl via a peripheral venous cannula (Group 1), or an equivalent volume of saline (Group 2).
 Twenty-eight per cent of patients who received fentanyl, but none given saline, coughed within one minute (P less than 0.0001).
 The second 150 patients were then randomly assigned to three equal pretreatment groups.
 Group 3 received 0.01 mg.kg-1 atropine iv one minute before fentanyl.
 Groups 4 and 5 received 0.2 mg.kg-1 morphine im, and 7.5 mg midazolam po, respectively, one hour before fentanyl.
 Thirty per cent of patients in Group 3, 6% in Group 4, and 40% in Group 5, had a cough response to fentanyl.
 Fentanyl, when given through a peripheral cannula, provoked cough in a considerable proportion of patients.
 This was not altered by premedication with atropine or midazolam, but was reduced after morphine (P less than 0.01).
 Coughing upon induction of anaesthesia is undesirable in some patients, and stimulation of cough by fentanyl in unpremedicated patients may be of clinical importance.

"Paraesthesiae and tetany induced by voluntary hyperventilation. Increased excitability of human cutaneous and motor axons.
 Anxiety can induce hyperventilation, and the resultant hypocapnia and hypocalcaemia can lead to paraesthesiae and tetany.
 To define the nature of the disturbance created in peripheral nerve, the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons was monitored in 6 normal subjects requested to hyperventilate until paraesthesiae developed in the hands, face and trunk.
 This occurred when alveolar PCO2 (PACO2) had declined on average by 20 mmHg.
 Spontaneous EMG activity developed when PACO2 had declined by a further 4 mmHg.
 Changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons were measured from changes in the compound action potentials evoked by stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist and recorded over the digital nerves of the index finger and over the thenar muscles, respectively.
 As PACO2 declined, the size of the compound sensory and muscle potentials evoked by a constant stimulus progressively increased, indicating an increase in axonal excitability.
 These changes occurred before paraesthesiae or tetany developed.
 In each subject there was a statistically significant inverse correlation between PACO2 and axonal excitability.
 Independent of this increase in axonal excitability, there was no significant change in the supernormal phase of the recovery cycle of cutaneous axons.
 Microneurographic recordings from the median nerve in 2 subjects revealed spontaneous bursting activity of cutaneous axons, perceived as paraesthesiae.
 It is concluded that the paraesthesiae and tetany induced by hyperventilation result solely from changes in the excitability of cutaneous and motor axons in the peripheral nerve, presumably due to an alteration in the electrical properties of the axonal membrane resulting from a reduced plasma [Ca2+].
 The supernormal phase may entrain the ectopic discharge and thereby determine the maximal discharge frequency of impulses in ectopically generated trains, but does not otherwise contribute to the physiological disturbance.

"Detection of bullous lung disease: conventional radiography vs digital storage phosphor radiography.
 The detection of fine linear contours and altered aeration are requirements for the radiologic diagnosis of bullous lung disease and are severe measures of the spatial and contrast resolution of chest imaging systems.
 We compared plain film radiography with five postprocessing algorithms of storage phosphor digital radiography (2144 x 1744 x 10 bit matrix with 0.2-mm pixel size) in the detection of CT-proved bullous lung disease (35 patients and 25 normal control subjects).
 Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis of 2160 observations by six interpreters was done to evaluate the observers' performance.
 By analysis of variance (p less than .05), we found that the default digital algorithm and the three edge-enhancing algorithms of high and medium frequencies performed less well than plain films did, but the differences fell short of statistical significance.
 Gray-scale reversal was the only digital algorithm that performed significantly less well than plain films did.
 We conclude that any differences between digital algorithms and plain films in the detection of bullous lung disease were too small to be detected in this study.
 Any difference between the two methods in providing clinically important, diagnostic information is likely to be insignificant.

"Acute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis.
 BACKGROUND.
 The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature.
 METHODS.
 Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed.
 Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period.
 RESULTS.
 Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI.
 During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group.
 The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients.
 Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms.
 Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year.
 Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection.

"Intratracheal surfactant administration restores gas exchange in experimental adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with viral pneumonia.
 The effect of intratracheal surfactant administration was studied in rats with adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with infection with nebulized Sendai virus.
 Thirty-six hours after infection, animals (n = 7) showed severely impaired gas exchange and acidosis during artificial ventilation (PaO2 = 152.2 +/- 18.7, PaCO2 = 65.3 +/- 19.2, pH = 7.26 +/- 0.11) with a pressure-controlled mode, standard frequency of 35/min, peak airway pressure of 15 cm H2O (15/0), inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2, and F1O2 = 1.
 Gas exchange improved (P = 0.02) with increased ventilator pressures with PEEP (25/4).
 Forty-eight hours after infection, blood gas tensions could no longer be significantly improved by these same ventilator settings (PaO2 = 123.8 +/- 31.0, PaCO2 = 95.1 +/- 43.6, pH = 7.12 +/- 0.16, n = 9).
 At this time, surfactant replacement dramatically increased arterial oxygenation within 5 min (PaO2 = 389.4 +/- 79.9) and resulted in a fourfold increase in PaO2 within 2 h.
 It is concluded that intratracheal surfactant administration is a promising approach in the treatment of respiratory failure during adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with viral pneumonia.

"Oxygen transport measurements to evaluate tissue perfusion and titrate therapy: dobutamine and dopamine effects.
 BACKGROUND: Increased cardiac index, oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) patterns were shown to characterize the physiologic status of surviving high-risk surgical patients, and indicate increased metabolic needs; relatively normal DO2 and VO2 values were found to characterize the sequential pattern of nonsurvivors who developed an early oxygen debt followed by lethal organ failure.
 The cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 values empirically determined from survivors' patterns were shown to improve outcome in prospective randomized trials.
 The present study considers these criteria to evaluate the tissue perfusion status as well as the effects of therapy on tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
 OBJECTIVE: To summarize new information on the temporal patterns of DO2, VO2, and oxygen debt on outcome and the effects of fluids and inotropes on these patterns in a wide range of clinical, temporal, and physiologic conditions.
 DESIGN: Descriptive analysis based on data gathered prospectively using a specified protocol.
 PATIENTS: High-risk patients with accidental or elective surgical trauma, and patients with or without sepsis or septic shock and organ failure.
 SETTING: University-run county hospital with a large trauma service.
 INTERVENTIONS: Fluids, dobutamine, and dopamine at various times and at various doses throughout critical illness of postoperative, posttraumatic, septic, and hypovolemic patients with and without lethal and nonlethal organ failure.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The pattern of DO2 plotted against the corresponding VO2 values in 437 consecutive critically ill surgical patients showed a wide variability and poor correlation probably because complex clinical conditions may obscure the supply-dependent and supply-independent VO2 relationships observed in normal dogs bled or given bacterial infusions.
 However, the use of specific therapy by well-defined protocols was shown to provide objective evidence of efficacy.
 Significant increases in DO2 and VO2 were previously shown after whole blood, packed red cells, and colloid administration, but not after crystalloid administration.
 Dobutamine administration in 715 circumstances in postoperative, traumatic, septic patients and patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and multiple organ failure significantly improved DO2 and VO2.
 Dopamine under comparable conditions produced less improvement in DO2 and VO2 than that of dobutamine; most of the VO2 changes were not significant.
 CONCLUSIONS: The monitored patterns of cardiac index, DO2, and VO2 may be used to evaluate the adequacy of tissue perfusion as well as the relative effectiveness of alternative therapies.
 Second, these physiologic criteria may be used to titrate therapy in order to achieve optimal outcome.
 Third, after colloids optimally expand the plasma volume, dobutamine may be used to enhance flow and the distribution of flow in order to improve tissue oxygenation.
 Vasodilators may be used when hypertensive episodes occur or there is an inadequate response to inotropic agents.
 Vasopressors are used as a last resort, usually in the terminal or preterminal state.

"Nasal continuous positive airway pressure facilitates respiratory muscle function during sleep in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and presumed respiratory muscle fatigue may benefit from therapeutic maneuvers aimed at reducing the magnitude of inspiratory muscle effort.
 Recent work has demonstrated that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can significantly reduce inspiratory effort and work of breathing in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure.
 Accordingly it was reasoned that prolonged CPAP administration may similarly reduce the work of breathing in stable COPD patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, thereby allowing recovery from respiratory muscle fatigue.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of employing nasal CPAP during sleep as a means of implementing this approach to reducing inspiratory muscle effort in such patients.
 Standard polysomnographic parameters were recorded during nocturnal administration of nasal CPAP in eight stable patients with severe COPD (FEV1 = 26.7 +/- 3.9% of predicted).
 Esophageal pressure, diaphragmatic (EMGdi) and parasternal intercostal (EMGic) electromyographic activity, arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2), and transcutaneous PCO2 (PtcCO2) were also measured.
 Breathing pattern was determined by respiratory inductive plethysmography.
 In each patient an optimum level of nasal CPAP could be determined that produced consistent reductions in indices of inspiratory muscle effort without changing tidal volume or breathing frequency.
 Highly significant reductions in the tidal excursions of esophageal pressure and the pressure-time integral for the inspiratory muscles occurred at the optimum CPAP level in all patients.
 EMGdi and EMGic were similarly reduced.
 SaO2 and PtcCO2 were unaffected by CPAP.
 These results indicate that nasal CPAP can effectively reduce inspiratory muscle effort during sleep in patients with severe COPD.

"The roles of inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of asthma and of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Studies of the inflammatory processes in asthma and in COPD have been hindered by the imprecise definitions of these diseases, the uncertainty as to the location of the relevant inflammatory sites for these diseases within the lungs, and the difficulties in relating observed histopathologic changes to the effects of particular proinflammatory leukocytes or their products.
 Circumstantial evidence exists implicating neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and monocytes in asthma pathogenesis based on increased numbers and activation of these cells in blood, BAL fluid, or biopsy material, and the propensity of these cells to release products causing tissue damage.
 There is increasing evidence that the accumulation and activation of these cells is orchestrated by lymphokines elaborated by sensitized T lymphocytes.
 In COPD, attention has been focused on the secretion of proteases by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, although there is no incontrovertible evidence that these are relevant to the disease pathogenesis in the majority of patients with normal serum concentrations of protease inhibitors.
 In the future, studies of the functions of inflammatory cells actually at the sites of inflammation using the techniques of immunocytochemistry and molecular biology may provide further information as to the role of these cells in the inflammatory processes associated with asthma and COPD.

 Septic metastatic endophthalmitis from Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess, first reported in seven cases treated at the Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, between 1981 and 1985, was seen in six similar cases at the same hospital in the subsequent 2 years.
 We conducted a retrospective search for factors that might be associated with these complications of pyogenic liver abscess.
 A total of 23 cases with septic metastatic lesions from pyogenic liver abscess were found between 1981 and 1987, and 164 cases of pyogenic liver abscess without septic metastatic lesions were identified as a comparison group.
 Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess, bacteremia, and the underlying diabetes mellitus were significantly more common in the study group than in the comparison group.
 Of the 23 patients with septic metastatic lesions, there were 14 cases (60.8%) of endophthalmitis or uveitis, 10 cases (43.4%) of pulmonary abscess and/or emboli, six cases (26.0%) of brain abscess and/or purulent meningitis, five cases (21.7%) of bacteriuria and/or prostate abscess, two cases (8.6%) of osteomyelitis and/or pyogenic arthritis, and one case (4.3%) of psoas abscess.

"A randomized trial of alternating chemotherapy versus best supportive care in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
 From April 1985 to September 1988, 128 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial evaluating chemotherapy (arm A) versus best supportive care (arm B).
 Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CE'P regimen) alternating every 4 weeks with methotrexate 30 mg/m2 IV day 1, etoposide 200 mg/m2 IV day 1, and lomustine (CCNU) 70 mg/m2 orally day 1 (MEC' regimen) until progression.
 Of the 123 patients (62 treated and 61 controls) eligible for survival, 115 were fully evaluable for response (58 treated and 57 controls).
 Response rates were 21% partial response, 53% stable disease, and 26% progressive disease in arm A, and 47% stable disease and 53% progressive disease in arm B.
 Median survival was 34.3 weeks (range, 4.3 to 218.6+ weeks) in arm A versus 21.1 weeks (range, 4.3 to 188.6 weeks) in arm B; the difference was not significant at P = .153 (Mantel-Cox).
 Subgroups of patients retrospectively analyzed by age, performance status, stage M0/M1, and weight loss or not showed no significant difference in survival.
 Poor-risk patients (at least two of the following: poor performance status, stage M1, weight loss) of arm A survived significantly longer than poor-risk patients of arm B (23.6 weeks v 12.4 weeks, Mantel-Cox P = .008); a significant difference in survival was also observed between nonsquamous cell patients of arm A and those of arm B (median survival, 38.6 weeks v 16.7 weeks; Mantel-Cox P = .041).
 Toxicity on the chemotherapy arm was hematologic (World Health Organization [WHO] grade greater than 3) in 12% of CE'P and in 13% of MEC' courses and gastroenteric (WHO grade greater than 3) in 24% of CE'P courses and in 8% of MEC' courses.
 Our alternating treatment was not significantly superior to supportive care.
 It is likely that certain subgroups of the NSCLC category may have an advantage with chemotherapy.

"The role of platelet-activating factor in the pulmonary response to inhaled bacterial endotoxin.
 Quantitative morphometric analyses were carried out on animals subjected to aerosols of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) to further define the role of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in the development of pulmonary injury.
 Hamsters were exposed to either saline aerosol or dilute aerosols of LPS (4 micrograms/m3) for standard lengths of time.
 Within each aerosol exposure group, animals were further subdivided into groups receiving either the PAF receptor binding antagonist, RP 48740, or saline injections.
 LPS inhalation resulted in decreased fixed lung volume, increased sequestration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and platelets in pulmonary capillaries, increased type I epithelial and endothelial cellular volumes, increased cellular interstitium, and increased endothelial pinocytotic vesicles.
 Treatment with RP 48740 either attenuated or abolished the ability of inhaled LPS to induce these structural alterations.
 The PAF antagonist also inhibited LPS-induced increases in pulmonary capillary permeability.
 It is concluded that PAF is one of the major injury-promoting mediators released upon inhalation exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of bacterial endotoxin.
 A major but not exclusive target of this mediator is the pulmonary vascular endothelium.

"Risk factors for the misdiagnosis of pneumothorax in the intensive care unit.
 OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors predisposing to the misdiagnosis of pneumothorax in the ICU.
 DESIGN: A prospective case series investigation.
 SETTING: A medical ICU service of a military referral hospital.
 PATIENTS: All adult medical ICU patients were evaluated during a 12-month period.
 Of 464 admissions, 28 (6%) were found to have acquired a pneumothorax during their medical ICU stay.
 INTERVENTIONS: Nineteen (67.9%) patients with pneumothorax were diagnosed correctly on initial presentation of their pneumothorax.
 The remaining nine (32.1%) patients' pneumothoraces were misdiagnosed at initial presentation.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Tension pneumothorax occurred more frequently in patients with an initially misdiagnosed pneumothorax (33.3%) than in patients with pneumothoraces that were correctly diagnosed during their medical ICU stay (5.3%) (p less than .06).
 Thirteen variables chosen prospectively were examined using a chi-square statistic.
 The following four variables occurred statistically more often in nine patients with an initially misdiagnosed pneumothorax: a) mechanical ventilation required at the time of the development of pneumothorax (p less than .05); b) an atypical radiographic location of the pneumothorax (p less than .05); c) altered mental status exhibited at the time of pneumothorax presentation (p less than .05); and d) development of pneumothorax after peak physician staffing hours (p less than .02).
 CONCLUSIONS: Certain medical ICU patients appear to be at higher risk for the initial misdiagnosis of pneumothorax.
 Familiarity with factors predisposing to this problem should allow for a higher index of suspicion for the diagnosis of pneumothorax in critically ill patients and possibly improve the early detection of pneumothorax.

"Bolus versus infusion regimens of etoposide and cisplatin in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a study of the North Central Cancer Treatment group 
 In an effort to test clinically the hypothesis that the duration of cellular exposure to etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (CDDP) is an important determinant of cytotoxicity, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing an outpatient bolus regimen of combined VP-16 and CDDP with a sequential infusion over 72 hours of these same two drugs.
 All patients had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, and survival was the primary end point.
 Of 113 patients randomly allocated to the study, 108 were assessable for response, survival, and toxicity.
 A major response was observed in 20 (37%) of 54 patients on the bolus regimen and in 16 (30%) of 54 patients receiving infusion therapy.
 The median time to progression was 61 and 88 days for bolus and infusion therapy, respectively.
 The median survival time was 148 and 157 days, respectively (P = .71).
 Study results were not consistent with the possibility that infusion therapy could be associated with a 50% improvement in median survival, i.e.
 from 5 months to 7 1/2 months.
 Toxicity was primarily myelosuppression and was significantly greater with the infusion regimen.
 We conclude that infusion therapy as tested in this protocol with VP-16 and CDDP does not offer any advantage in response rate, time to disease progression, or survival as compared with bolus therapy.
 In addition, infusion therapy is associated with a greater degree of neutropenia and more treatment-related deaths.

"Airway evaluation in children with use of ultrafast CT: pitfalls and recommendations.
 Ultrafast computed tomographic (CT) evaluation of the airway can be performed with either 50-msec low-resolution images (cine CT) or 100-msec high-resolution images (high-resolution CT).
 To determine the best imaging strategy for ultrafast CT of the pediatric airway, the authors prospectively compared ultrafast CT and endoscopy in 20 children.
 Both studies were performed in 11 patients; cine CT alone was performed in six and high-resolution CT alone in three.
 Six patients had normal anatomy.
 Six patients had focal tracheal stenoses, four had tracheomalacia or laryngomalacia, one had a laryngoesophageal cleft, one had irregularity and narrowing in the subglottic area, one had laryngeal papillomas, and one had focal stenosis with stoma granuloma.
 Cine CT results agreed with those of endoscopy in 10 of 17 cases.
 In five cases focal stenosis was misinterpreted with cine CT as tracheomalacia.
 High-resolution CT results agreed with those of endoscopy in 10 of 14 cases.
 The results of a technique that combined high-resolution CT for the entire airway and cine CT at selected areas agreed with those of endoscopy in 10 of 11 cases; only a tracheoesophageal cleft was missed with the combined technique.
 For the greatest diagnostic accuracy with ultrafast CT in evaluation of the pediatric airway, both cine and high-resolution modes should be used.

"Estrogen and progesterone receptors in lymphangioleiomyomatosis, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and sclerosing hemangioma of the lung.
 The therapeutic options in the treatment of lung neoplasia usually have not included hormonal therapy, unlike those for primary tumors of other sites (e.g., breast).
 However, two mesenchymal proliferations of lung, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), and one epithelial tumor, sclerosing hemangioma (SH), have a significant female predilection and may benefit from such hormonal therapy.
 The authors investigated five cases each of EHE and lymphangioleiomyomatosis and four cases of SH for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and 17-beta estradiol in paraffin-embedded tissue.
 Only one case each of lymphangioleiomyomatosis and EHE expressed 17-beta estradiol.
 All of the other cases were negative.
 These findings are contrary to the viewpoint held in published literature, especially in case reports of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, describing patients with positive estrogen and progesterone receptor results.
 Consequently, a number of issues must be considered in the clinical and immunohistochemical evaluation of the estrogen and progesterone receptor status of these rare pulmonary neoplasms.

"Serotypes of respiratory isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae compared with the capsular types included in the current pneumococcal vaccine.
 The serotypes of 474 clinically significant Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory isolates collected during a national surveillance study in 1987-1988 were compared to the capsular types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine licensed for use in the United States.
 Overall, 355 isolates (74.9%) belonged to types included in the current vaccine, while another 65 (13.7%) were types serologically related to vaccine types and likely to be protective by virtue of cross-reactivity.
 Relatively few isolates (9.1%) belonged to nonvaccine serotypes, and only 2.3% were nontypable.
 The mucoid serotype 3 was most frequent (13.1% of total), followed by 19F (9.3%), 23F (7.4%), 6B and 14 (5.7% each), and 4 and 6A (5.5% each).
 The most frequent type not included in the vaccine was type 16 (2.1% of all isolates).
 Thus, nearly 89% of respiratory isolates included in this study were encompassed within the antigenic spectrum of the currently marketed pneumococcal vaccine.

"Differential responses of the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lung in sheep to Escherichia coli endotoxin.
 Although intravenous Escherichia coli endotoxin has been used extensively in experimental studies to increase lung endothelial permeability, the effect of E.
 coli endotoxin on lung epithelial permeability has not been well studied.
 To examine this issue in sheep, bidirectional movement of protein across the lung epithelial barrier was studied by labeling the vascular space with 131I-albumin and by instilling 3 ml/kg of an isosmolar protein solution with 125I-albumin into the alveoli.
 E.
 coli endotoxin was administered according to one of three protocols: intravenous alone (5-500 micrograms/kg), intravenous (5 micrograms/kg) plus low-dose alveolar endotoxin (10 micrograms/kg), and high-dose alveolar endotoxin alone (50-100 micrograms/kg).
 Alveolar liquid clearance was estimated based on the concentration of the instilled native protein.
 Sheep were studied for either 4 or 24 h.
 Although intravenous E.
 coli endotoxin produced a marked increase in transvascular protein flux and interstitial pulmonary edema, there was no effect on the clearance of either the vascular (131I-albumin) or the alveolar (125I-albumin) protein tracer across the epithelial barrier.
 High-dose alveolar E.
 coli endotoxin caused a 10-fold increase in the number of leukocytes, particularly neutrophils, that accumulated in the air spaces.
 In spite of the marked chemotactic effect of alveolar endotoxin, there was no change in the permeability of the epithelial barrier to the vascular or alveolar protein tracers.
 Also, alveolar epithelial liquid clearance was normal.
 Morphologic studies confirmed that the alveolar epithelial barrier was not injured by either intravenous or alveolar E.
 coli endotoxin.
 Thus, the alveolar epithelium in sheep is significantly more resistant than the lung endothelium to the injurious effects of E.

"Health effects of volcanic ash: a repeat study.
 The Mount Sakurajima volcano in Kyushu, Japan, is proximal to a large residential area, and it emits an enormous amount of volcanic ash during frequent eruptions.
 In our previous study, we investigated, for the first time, respiratory effects of chronic exposure to volcanic ash.
 The study demonstrated a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms, even in the area of highest exposure; only a slight excess prevalence of symptoms appeared to be associated with exposure to volcanic ash.
 To confirm the findings of our previous study, the prevalence study of chronic respiratory symptoms for residents was repeated in Kanoya and Tashiro, which are located 25 and 50 km, respectively, from the crater of Mt.
 Sakurajima.
 The concentration of suspended particulate matter in Kanoya frequently exceeded the national environmental quality standards and, during summer and winter, was 2-3 times higher than that found in Tashiro.
 Women who were 30-59 y of age and who had resided in Kanoya or Tashiro for more than 3 y completed a modified ATS-DLD questionnaire.
 The prevalence of nonspecific respiratory disease was low, i.e., 6.5% in Kanoya and 6.2% in Tashiro; similar prevalences were found in women who had never smoked.
 When we restricted the analysis to individuals without a history of occupational exposure to dusts and who had no exposure to passive smoking, there was a slightly higher prevalence of nonspecific respiratory disease in Kanoya than Tashiro, but the difference was not significant.
 Eye symptoms were equally prevalent in the two areas.

"Sleep-induced periodic breathing and apnea: a theoretical study.
 To elucidate the mechanisms that lead to sleep-disordered breathing, we have developed a mathematical model that allows for dynamic interactions among the chemical control of respiration, changes in sleep-waking state, and changes in upper airway patency.
 The increase in steady-state arterial PCO2 accompanying sleep is shown to be inversely related to the ventilatory response to CO2.
 Chemical control of respiration becomes less stable during the light stage of sleep, despite a reduction in chemoresponsiveness, due to a concomitant increase in ""plant gain"" (i.e., responsiveness of blood gases to ventilatory changes).
 The withdrawal of the ""wakefulness drive"" during sleep onset represents a strong perturbation to respiratory control: higher magnitudes and rates of withdrawal of this drive favor instability.
 These results may account for the higher incidence of periodic breathing observed during light sleep and sleep onset.
 Periodic ventilation can also result from repetitive alternations between sleep onset and arousal.
 The potential for instability is further compounded if the possibility of upper airway occlusion is also included.
 In systems with high controller gains, instability is mediated primarily through chemoreflex overcompensation.
 However, in systems with depressed chemoresponsiveness, rapid sleep onset and large blood gas fluctuations trigger repetitive episodes of arousal and hyperpnea alternating with apneas that may or may not be obstructive.
 Between these extremes, more complex patterns can arise from the interaction between chemoreflex-mediated oscillations of shorter-cycle-duration (approximately 36 s) and longer-wavelength (approximately 60-80 s) state-driven oscillations.

"Plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations in acute respiratory failure associated with sepsis: preliminary study.
 Plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-ANP) concentrations were measured during mechanical ventilation in nine patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) associated with sepsis.
 The relationships between alpha-ANP and pulmonary hemodynamic variables were examined.
 A total of 22 measurements of alpha-ANP and other variables were obtained.
 The mean plasma alpha-ANP concentration of 22 measurements was 120.1 +/- 79.8 pg/ml (normal 31.7 +/- 12.0, mean +/- SD).
 Plasma alpha-ANP concentrations correlated with mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) (r = .703, p less than .01) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (r = .606, p less than .01), but not with other variables.
 These findings suggest that alpha-ANP elevation may be related to the increases in MPAP and PVR in ARF associated with sepsis.

"Sucralfate versus antacids or H2-antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis: a meta-analysis on efficacy and pneumonia rate.
 OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists and antacids have been the basic drugs for the prevention of stress bleeding in ICU patients during the past decade.
 Recently, drugs without major influence on gastric pH have been investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis.
 Therefore, a meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel test) was undertaken to determine the efficacy of sucralfate in the prevention of macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as the influence of sucralfate on the frequency of pulmonary infections.
 RESULTS: The efficacy of sucralfate was compared with H2-antagonists in nine studies and with antacids in eight studies.
 Sucralfate was significantly more effective than H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.532, 95% confidence interval 0.303 to 0.933) and equally as effective as antacids (typical odds ratio 0.868, 95% confidence interval 0.452 to 1.667).
 The pneumonia rates of those patients who were administered sucralfate were compared with the rates of those patients who were given H2-antagonists in five studies and with those patients who were given antacids in four studies.
 Pneumonia was a significantly more frequent occurrence under prophylaxis with H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.498, 95% confidence interval 0.316 to 0.783) as well as with antacids (typical odds ratio 0.402, 95% confidence interval 0.235 to 0.687).

"The ""natural history"" of the transplanted lung: rates of pulmonary functional change in long-term survivors of heart-lung transplantation.
 Long-term pulmonary function in HLT is well preserved with no evidence of functional decline as a result of transplant ""aging,"" providing the allografts remain free of complications.
 Long-term survivors with OB appear to be able to maintain adequate oxygenation despite the marked alterations of pulmonary function.
 The ability to preserve gas exchange at reasonable levels of oxygenation may be the factors permitting extended survival with OB for mean periods of 36.0 months or greater.
 Preliminary studies suggest that a declining FEF50/FVC, at a time when pulmonary function is normal, may be an index of impending airway disease.
 Physiologically, from a long-term point of view, HLT remains a viable option for selected patients with end-stage cardiopulmonary disease.

 In a prospective investigation of 17 children with severe croup, we analyzed the effect of epinephrine inhalations and mild sedation with chloral hydrate on transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (tcPCO2), pulse oximetry measurements, and croup scores.
 There was a highly significant reduction (p less than 0.001) in the tcPCO2 values and croup scores after inhalation of epinephrine.
 The changes in the tcPCO2 values correlated with the clinical findings.
 Mild sedation also significantly improved the croup scores but failed to influence the tcPCO2 values.

 This study reports on the relationship of airway hyperresponsiveness (AH) with respiratory symptoms and diurnal peak flow expiratory (PEF) variation in 221 hyperresponsive patients with moderately severe airways obstruction.
 The disease was in a stable phase in all patients.
 Closely adhering to the American Thoracic Society criteria, patients were divided into three syndrome diagnoses based on a standardized history: asthma (n = 81), asthmatic bronchitis (AB, n = 69), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [( COPD] n = 44); 27 subjects could not be placed in any group.
 Mean (+/- SEM) log2 PC20 histamine values were significantly lower in the asthmatic group (-2.77 +/- 0.20 mg/ml) than in the COPD (-0.89 +/- 0.29 mg/ml) and AB groups (-1.37 +/- 0.25 mg/ml; one-way ANOVA, p less than 0.001).
 However, considerable overlap of individual responses existed.
 Differences between the groups could not be attributed to differences in prechallenge FEV1 levels.
 For every level of FEV1, asthmatic subjects were more hyperresponsive than patients with COPD.
 The dependence of PC20 on prechallenge FEV1 was comparable in all groups.
 There was a significant correlation between the degree of AH and diurnal PEF variation (rho = -0.401, p less than 0.001), which was stronger in asthma (rho = -0.409) than in COPD (rho = -0.325).
 Despite this obvious association, a wide range of diurnal PEF variation values existed for every level of PC20, indicating that PEF variability and AH are not interchangeable.
 The relationships between symptoms and both AH levels and PEF variation were weak.
 No significant differences were found between syndrome diagnosis groups with respect to diurnal PEF variation.

"Effects of supplemental oxygen administration in an infant with pulmonary artery hypertension.
 In patients with pulmonary disease, pulmonary artery hypertension often occurs as a result of pulmonary artery vasoconstriction, primarily from hypoxia and alveolar hypotension.
 In this report we describe the hemodynamic effects of breathing supplemental oxygen in a child with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary artery hypertension.
 These hemodynamic effects include an improvement in oxygenation, an increase in systemic vascular resistance, and a decrease in the pulmonary vascular resistance.
 As a direct result of these changes in vascular resistances, alterations of heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume, aortic pressure, oxygen consumption, and pulmonary artery pressure have been shown to occur.
 Oxygen is widely used to treat many physiologic conditions.
 However, during the administration of supplemental oxygen, rarely do we recognize the hemodynamic changes associated with its use.
 These hemodynamic effects must be clearly understood and appreciated before oxygen administration in any clinical situation.

 Laryngeal insufflation induced phrenic nerve apnea, stimulation of postinspiratory neurons, and stable membrane potentials in inspiratory and expiratory cells consistent with postinspiratory inhibition.
 Usually the membrane potential of each neuronal type cycled through an expiratory level before onset of the first recovery breath.
 Variants of the apnea response, probably reflecting the aspiration reflex or sniffing, sneezing, coughing, and swallowing, were also observed.
 These latter patterns showed oscillation between inspiration and postinspiration without an apparent intervening stage II expiratory phase.
 However, stage II expiratory activity always preceded onset of the first ramp inspiration after such a pattern.
 These findings suggest that activation of postinspiratory mechanisms causes profound alterations in the respiratory pattern and that stage II expiration importantly modulates recovery of ramp inspiratory activity.
 The mechanism of this latter effect may be inhibition of early inspiratory neurons with consequent postinhibitory rebound.

"Prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in patients with mucous hypersecretion.
 In order to determine the prognosis of patients with chronic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we evaluated clinical, laboratory, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) data at the onset of IPF in 25 patients who survived beyond 1 yr (nine women and 16 men, 59 +/- 3 yr of age, mean +/- SE).
 When the patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had or did not have mucous hypersecretion, 11 patients with hypersecretion (Group A) had a poorer survival rate (6 yr) than did 14 patients without hypersecretion (Group B) (10 yr) (p less than 0.01).
 Further, there was a significant negative correlation between sputum volume and the duration of survival in 25 patients (r = -0.55, p less than 0.01).
 Before glucocorticoid treatment, we also found significantly larger numbers of neutrophils (17%) and eosinophils (5%) in differential cell counts of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in Group A than in Group B (neutrophils, 1%; eosinophils, 0.6%) (p less than 0.05 each).
 Chest radiographic findings and other laboratory data including pulmonary function tests did not correlate with the survival rate.
 These findings suggest that mucous hypersecretion as well as neutrophils and eosinophils in BALF are among the determinants of prognosis in patients with chronic IPF.

"Symptomatic pericardial effusion in lung cancer patients: the role of fluid cytology.
 During the years 1975-1988, twenty lung cancer patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion were treated conservatively at our center.
 Echocardiography demonstrated small pericardial effusion in 2 patients, medium size effusion in 3 patients and large amount of fluid in 15 patients.
 Fifteen patients developed cardiac tamponade; in three of these patients, this was the presenting manifestation of lung cancer.
 Pericardiocentesis resulted in prompt, though temporary, symptomatic relief in all patients.
 Fluid cytology demonstrated suspected malignant cells in 2 patients and malignant cells in 13 patients.
 Based on cytology, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was established in six patients, small cell carcinoma in three patients, and epidermoid carcinoma in one patient.
 All patients were dead within 9 months from the time of diagnosis of pericardial effusion; 17 died within less than 3 months.
 It is concluded that pericardial effusion in lung cancer is indicative of rapid tumor progression and short survival.
 Fluid cytology provides an immediate and accurate means of diagnosis.

"Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor with very high serum human chorionic gonadotropin.
 Most patients with disseminated nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) have an excellent prognosis with modern chemotherapy, although certain subgroups with a worse prognosis have been described.
 One such subgroup includes patients with high serum levels of the tumor marker, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).
 Sixteen patients of 104 treated for NSGCT at the CRC Wessex Medical Oncology Unit (Southampton, UK) presented with serum HCG greater than 25,000.
 Most of these patients exhibited features of the ""choriocarcinoma syndrome"" with bulky, rapidly progressive disease; frequent pulmonary, hepatic, and central nervous system complications; and a generally poorer response to standard NSGCT chemotherapy.
 Histologic identification of trophoblastic tumor was not made in all patients and is not essential for the diagnosis of the syndrome; indeed, closed biopsy may be contradicted in some circumstances because of the risk of hemorrhage.
 The NSGCT patients with poor prognosis, including patients with the choriocarcinoma syndrome, must be clearly identified in order to improve management and, eventually, cure rates.

"Second place--Resident Clinical Science Award 1990. A porcine model of chronic endobronchial obstruction.
 To elucidate the effects of both prolonged lobar atelectasis and subsequent re-expansion in a non-thoracotomized animal, we have developed a chronic, reversible porcine model of endobronchial obstruction.
 Eight adolescent pigs underwent the bronchoscopic placement of a left lower lobe bronchial plug.
 The obstruction was left in place for 24 hours.
 Four pigs then had the balloon bronchoscopically removed, while four controls underwent sham removal of the balloon.
 All animals showed significant atelectasis of the obstructed lobe compared to non-obstructed lobes at 24 hours.
 Pulmonary blood flow decreased significantly 24 hours after obstruction compared to pre-obstruction values in the collapsed lobe in all animals.
 Re-expansion was followed by arterial hypoxemia, which was accompanied by an increase in relative blood flow to the partially re-expanded lobe in the experimental group.
 No significant changes in lung water content occurred in the study group compared to controls.

"Pathogenesis of respiratory infections due to influenza virus: implications for developing countries.
 The influenza viruses have an important and distinctive place among respiratory viruses: they change antigenic character at irregular intervals, infect individuals of all ages, cause illnesses characterized by constitutional symptoms and tracheobronchitis, produce yearly epidemics associated frequently with excess morbidity and mortality, and predispose the host to bacterial superinfections.
 Much is known about influenza viruses, but their role in respiratory infections among children in developing countries is poorly understood, and the risk factors that lead to the excess morbidity and mortality have not been identified clearly.
 Among the many risk factors that may be important are alterations in host immunity, malnutrition, prior or coincident infections with other microorganisms, inhaled pollutants, and lack of access to medical care.
 There is a great need for research that can establish more precisely the role these and other unidentified factors play in the pathogenesis of influenza infections in children in the developing world.

"The prognostic significance of pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
 Pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were assayed in 288 patients presenting with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) between 1976 and 1985.
 Patients were routinely staged by physical examination, chest x-ray, bone, brain, and liver scans, and bone marrow evaluation.
 Clinical response and survival were assessed following treatment with combination chemotherapy as part of four clinical trials.
 Patients with extensive disease (ED) presented with a higher incidence (108 of 147, 73%) of abnormally elevated LDH (greater than 193 IU/L) than those (65 of 141, 46%) with limited disease (LD) (P = 2 x 10(-6)).
 Forty percent of patients had an initial normal LDH level and a higher response rate (89 of 108, 82%; complete response [CR], 47%) than those with elevated values of LDH (119 of 156, 76%; CR, 29%).
 The CR rate varied inversely with the level of LDH in patients with LD (P = .026) but not in those with ED (P = .300).
 The median survival time and 1-year and 2-year survival rates for patients with elevated LDH were 39 weeks and 33% and 6%, respectively, whereas for those with a normal LDH level these were 53 weeks and 54% and 16%, respectively.
 Patients with LD and elevated levels of LDH manifested a higher relative death rate (1.63:1) when compared with patients with LD and LDH in the normal range (P = .0083).
 The survival of patients with ED did not differ between those with normal and elevated levels of LDH (P = .273).
 A significant survival advantage persisted for patients with LDH in the normal range following adjustments for extent of disease, performance status (PS), and treatment protocol (P = .044, log-rank analysis).
 In conclusion, serum LDH appears to be a significant independent pretreatment prognostic factor in patients with SCLC that correlates with stage of disease, response to treatment, and survival.

"Cancer chemotherapy after solid organ transplantation.
 To assess how well chemotherapy is tolerated after solid organ transplantation, we reviewed our experience at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh with five patients aged 1 to 12 years.
 Four patients had a liver transplant, indications for which were hepatoblastoma in two patients, hepatic failure secondary to Wilms' tumor chemoradiotherapy in one patient, and familial intrahepatic cholestasis in one patient.
 A fifth patient received a cardiac transplant for unresectable angiosarcoma of the right atrium.
 After transplant, chemotherapy was given for the treatment of the primary malignancy in four of the patients.
 The patient with familial intrahepatic cholestasis received chemotherapy for secondary lymphoproliferative disease that had not responded to the cessation of immunosuppression.
 All patients other than this patient were on immunosuppression with prednisone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg daily) and cyclosporine (to maintain serum levels at 800 to 1000 ng/ml radioimmunoassay) throughout the duration of chemotherapy.
 Courses of chemotherapy included one or more of the following agents: Adriamycin (Adr, 20 mg/m2 daily, three patients), Cyclophosphamide (Ctx, 1 gm/m2, one patient), cisplatin (CDDP, 90 mg/m2, one patient), Vincristine (Vcr, greater than 0.75 to 1.5 mg/m2, three patients), Actinomycin D (Act-D, 7.5 micrograms/kg, one patient), Ifosfamide (I, 1800 mg/m2, one patient) and Etoposide (VP-16, 100 mg/m2, one patient).
 All patients received greater than or equal to 3 courses (range, 3 to 9; mean, 5) of chemotherapy every 3 to 4 weeks.
 Dose reductions were made because of neutropenia in three patients but none were greater than 50%.
 Severe rejection was seen in one patient who had, however, manifested evidence of rejection prior to his first postoperative course of chemotherapy.
 No nephro or cardiac toxicity was seen.
 This preliminary experience suggests that chemotherapy is well tolerated after solid organ transplantation.

"Diagnosis of pneumonia by cultures, bacterial and viral antigen detection tests, and serology with special reference to antibodies against pneumococcal antigens.
 In a prospective study of the etiology of pneumonia 196 adult patients were included.
 One of the following criteria was required for diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia: isolation of pneumococci from blood; isolation from transtracheal aspirate; isolation from sputum or nasopharynx or detection of capsular antigen in sputum in combination with a significant increase in antibodies against at least one pneumococcal antigen (type-specific capsular polysaccharide, C-polysaccharide, pneumolysin); or increase in antibodies against two pneumococcal antigens.
 Pneumococcal pneumonia was diagnosed in 63 patients (32%).
 Other diagnoses were nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae isolated from transtracheal aspirates, 9; Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnosed by serology, 17; Chlamydia psittaci, 6; and viral infections, 42.
 Twenty-two patients (11%) had evidence of infection with more than one agent.

"The burden of acute respiratory infection due to measles in developing countries and the potential impact of measles vaccine.
 Measles is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in developing countries.
 Hospital and community-based studies of ALRI have found that measles accounts for 6%-21% of the morbidity and 8%-93% of the mortality due to ALRI.
 Although live attenuated measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines in use today, measles has not been controlled in many parts of the world, primarily because the levels of vaccine coverage required to interrupt measles transmission have not been achieved.
 In addition, in some areas, a large percentage of cases of measles occur in infants who are younger than the age recommended for vaccination.
 Recent studies suggest that the Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine may be more immunogenic than other vaccine strains in young infants.
 A substantial proportion of ALRI could be prevented by increasing measles vaccine coverage and by the use of particular vaccine strains in younger children.

"Polysialic acid of the neural cell adhesion molecule distinguishes small cell lung carcinoma from carcinoids.
 The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) exists in various types of neuroendocrine cells and their tumors.
 A typical feature of NCAM is polysialic acid, of which the chain length is developmentally regulated.
 The authors have performed a comparative immunohistochemical study on small cell lung carcinomas and bronchial as well as gastrointestinal carcinoids with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 735 reactive with the long-chain form of polysialic acid.
 The small cell lung carcinomas, irrespective of their histological type, were positive for polysialic acid.
 Metastatic tumor cell complexes also exhibited immunostaining.
 The tumor cell-surface-associated immunostaining for polysialic acid was sensitive to endoneuraminidase.
 The mature and atypical bronchial and gastrointestinal carcinoids were not immunoreactive for polysialic acid.
 Cytoplasmic staining in groups of cells of carcinoids (2 of 28 cases) was due to nonspecific antibody binding, which could be prevented by increased ion strength.
 These data indicate that neuroendocrine tumors of the lung can be distinguished by their content of highly sialylated NCAM.

"Transient neuromuscular impairment resulting from prolonged inhalation of halothane and enflurane.
 Inhalation anesthesia first with halothane followed by enflurane relieved a patient with status asthmaticus who was refractory to conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation.
 After 13 days of anesthesia while on mechanical ventilation and employing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, significant neuromuscular impairment, manifested by tetraplegia and sensory disturbance, developed.
 Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16.
 Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved.
 Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane.
 Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane.
 The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

"Continuous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in acute brain injury: injection of mannitol during hyperventilation.
 Global cerebral oxygenation, perfusion pressure, and expired pCO2 were continuously monitored in 10 adults with acute severe closed head trauma.
 Cerebral oxygenation was monitored by fiberoptic catheter oximetry, which allowed simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular bulb oxyhemoglobin saturation.
 Intracranial pressure levels over 20 mm Hg were recorded several times in all patients, in spite of sedation, muscle paralysis, and profound hyperventilation.
 Intracranial hypertension was frequently associated with oligemic cerebral hypoxia, identified as abnormally low jugular oxygen saturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation.
 Intracranial hypertension was then managed with intravenous administration of mannitol boluses, which yielded simultaneous decreases in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral oxygenation to highly statistically significant levels.
 Monitoring cerebral oxygenation was clinically useful because it allowed identification of impaired cerebral oxygenation even when cerebral perfusion pressure was normal.
 It is therefore proposed as a new monitoring technique, to supplement conventional monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure.

"Bronchial cartilage alterations in lung transplantation.
 Changes in the hyaline cartilage of the proximal bronchial tree were investigated in a group of combined heart-lung and double-lung recipients with and without OB.
 Ossification, calcification and fibrovascular ingrowth into the normally avascular hyaline bronchial cartilage were observed in almost all patients and were independent of small or large airway inflammation.
 Alterations in the integrity of hyaline cartilage have been produced by others in animals by ligation of the blood supply.
 Finding similar changes in airway cartilage of all transplanted lungs argues that there is relatively poor perfusion to the proximal air-conducting passage.
 Such a mechanism may contribute to the development of OB, bronchiectasis and a predilection for infections following pulmonary transplantation.

"Vaccination of cotton rats with a chimeric FG glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus induces minimal pulmonary pathology on challenge.
 The cotton rat model of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was used to study the safety and efficacy of a chimeric FG glycoprotein that was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus vector.
 Histologic and virologic examination of vaccinated rat lungs was done after challenge with RSV.
 When rats were challenged 1 month after vaccination, severe pulmonary inflammation characterized by both a mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate and 30%-40% involvement of lung tissue was observed with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine.
 The FG glycoprotein induced minimal lung inflammation (involving 2%-5% of the lung), while negative controls had 1%-3% lung involvement.
 Two doses with as little as 20 ng of FG glycoprotein formulated in an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant completely protected the cotton rats from RSV challenge.
 Thus the chimeric FG glycoprotein is highly immunogenic and induces minimal pulmonary inflammation in the cotton rat model.

"Isolation and identification of viral agents in Argentinian children with acute lower respiratory tract infection.
 From a total population of 1,002 children with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), identification of virus was achieved in 304 cases.
 In this survey, 1,000 nasopharyngeal aspirate and 13 lung tissue samples were tested in four cell lines (HEp-2, MRC-5, MDCK, and LLC-MK2) and by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), while 242 paired sera were studied by complement fixation.
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequently detected agent (n = 183), followed by adenovirus (n = 28), parainfluenza (n = 5) and 3 (n = 16) viruses, and influenza A (n = 10) and B (n = 4) viruses.
 The sensitivity and specificity of IIF identification vs.
 isolation in cell culture were high for RSV (91.5% and 94.9%, respectively).
 However, IIF proved poorly sensitive for detection of adenovirus (sensitivity, 23.8%; specificity, 100%).
 The complement-fixation test proved the least effective, with a sensitivity of only 41.5%.
 Therefore, on the basis of our experience, it appears that the yield for positive diagnosis of virus is increased if both isolation in multiple cell lines and identification by means of IIF are used.
 Our survey provides for the first time reliable data on the viral etiology of ALRI in Argentina, as determined by three different methods.

"Physician practices in the prevention of venous thromboembolism.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk hospital patients.
 DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review.
 SETTING: A community-wide study in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts.
 PATIENTS: A total of 2017 patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of age, length of hospitalization, and the presence of at least one additional major risk factor, 17% of 151,349 discharges (25,410 patients) were identified as being at high risk for venous thromboembolism.
 Eight percent of these discharges were randomly selected for medical record review.
 Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism was received by 32% of these high-risk patients.
 Prophylaxis use among the 16 study hospitals varied widely, ranging from 9% to 56%, and was higher in teaching hospitals than in nonteaching hospitals (44% compared with 19%; P less than 0.001).
 One or more of the following methods of prophylaxis was used: low-dose heparin (78%), intermittent calf compression (13%), warfarin (12%), and inferior vena caval filter (3%).

"Effects of high- and low-carbohydrate meals on maximum exercise performance in chronic airflow obstruction.
 The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of isocaloric liquid meals with high fat (55 percent) and low carbohydrate (28 percent) content (Pulmocare) to meals with low fat (30 percent) and high carbohydrate (53 percent) content (Ensureplus) on exercise performance in subjects with chronic airflow obstruction (CAO).
 Twelve stable subjects with CAO (FEV1 = 1.30 +/- 0.47 L) underwent incremental symptom-limited exercise tests 90 minutes following the ingestion of 920 calories of EnsurePlus HN (E), 920 calories of Pulmocare (P), or a noncaloric placebo (C).
 Tests were performed on three days, in a double-blind randomized fashion.
 Expired gases were collected continuously and analyzed every 30 seconds.
 The mean maximal work load after E (81 +/- 24 W) was significantly less than that after P (88 +/- 21 W) or C (88 +/- 24 W).
 The mean ventilation at exhaustion was similar after E (48 +/- 13 L/min), P (51 +/- 11 L/min), and C (49 +/- 10 L/min).
 In comparison to C, six of the 12 individuals had a decreased work load following E, while only one had a decreased maximal tolerated work load following P.
 The results of this study suggest that meals with a higher fat and lower carbohydrate content may be less likely to impair work performance of patients with CAO in the absorptive phase than meals with a lower fat and higher carbohydrate content.
 These findings may have clinical significance to patients with CAO who complain of postprandial exertional dyspnea.

"Protected bronchoalveolar lavage. A new bronchoscopic technique to retrieve uncontaminated distal airway secretions.
 We tested the effectiveness of protected bronchoalveolar lavage (PBAL), performed through a protected transbronchoscopic balloon-tipped (PBT) catheter, in collecting distal airway secretions with a minimal degree of contamination.
 The PBAL had less than or equal to 1% squamous epithelial cells in 91% of specimens and an absence of bacterial growth in 59% of patients without pneumonia.
 Using a threshold of 10(4) cfu/ml we had one false positive result in 33 patient without pneumonia and one false negative in 13 patients with pneumonia.
 Quantitative bacterial cultures of the PBAL specimens had a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92%, with a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 92%.
 The diagnostic efficiency was 96%.
 The presence of intracellular organisms in much greater than or equal to 2% of the recovered alveolar cells (Giemsa stain) was seen in all but two patients with pneumonia (on corticosteroids) and in none of the patients without pneumonia.
 Gram stains of the PBAL specimens were positive in all but one patient with pneumonia and negative in all but one patient without infection (patient with endobronchial narrowing secondary to neoplasm with false positive cultures).
 Either the Giemsa or the Gram stain was positive in all patients with pneumonia, allowing early and accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection before the results of cultures were available.
 The time off antibiotic therapy before bronchoscopy did not affect the result of PBAL cultures, contrary to what we observed for the protected brush specimen.

"Ventilatory compensation for lactacidosis in ponies: role of carotid chemoreceptors and lung afferents.
 We investigated changes in arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and pulmonary ventilation (VE) in normal, carotid chemoreceptor-denervated, and hilar nerve-denervated ponies during intravenous lactic acid infusion at rest and treadmill exercise at 1.8 mph-5% grade (mild) and 1.8 mph-15% grade (moderate).
 Lactic acid, (0.5 M) infusion of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.20 ml.min-1.kg-1 at rest and mild and moderate exercise increased arterial [H+] linearly throughout the 10 min of acid infusion.
 At 10 min of infusion, arterial [H+] had increased approximately 20 nmol/l (0.2 pH units) for each condition and group.
 Under most conditions, the temporal pattern of PaCO2 during acid infusion was biphasic.
 At rest and during mild exercise in all groups, and in carotid chemoreceptor-denervated ponies during moderate exercise, PaCO2 increased approximately 2 Torr (P less than 0.05) during the first 2 min of acid infusion.
 However, in normal ponies during moderate exercise, PaCO2 was not changed from control in the first 2 min of infusion.
 Between 2 and 10 min of infusion at rest and mild and moderate exercise in all groups, there was a 5-Torr significant decrease in PaCO2, which did not differ (P greater than 0.10) between groups.
 VE increased between 15-30 s and 2 min of infusion, but VE changed minimally between 2 and 10 min of infusion at rest and exercise in all groups of ponies.
 We conclude that lactacidosis does increase VE at rest and submaximal exercise in the pony.

"Nasal positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure. Difficult and time-consuming procedure for nurses.
 Intubation and mechanical ventilation are well-established techniques in the management of patients with acute respiratory failure; however, there are situations in which these procedures cannot be used safely for various reasons.
 A recently described noninvasive technique, nasal positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV), has been developed for home ventilation of certain patients with chronic ventilatory insufficiency.
 We hypothesized that NPPV could be used in selected patients in whom intubation and mechanical ventilation were clearly indicated, but not immediately possible, or even contraindicated.
 Six patients were treated with NPPV during an episode of acute respiratory failure and enrolled in a prospective study.
 We found that NPPV was successful in avoiding intubation, but only in the three patients suffering from a restrictive pulmonary disorder, whereas the procedure was unsuccessful in patients with obstructive disorders.
 Moreover, in every patient, acute NPPV was very time-consuming for the nursing staff: in patients with restrictive disorders, a nurse had to monitor a patient submitted to NPPV during 41 +/- 9 percent of the duration of ventilation and during 91 +/- 9 percent of the NPPV time in patients with obstructive disorders.
 We conclude that acute NPPV may be attempted in selected patients with acute respiratory failure, predominantly patients with restrictive respiratory disorders, but that this procedure is very time-consuming for nurses.

 Eleven patients (UT group) were not receiving glucocorticoids when first seen at our clinic; 29 patients (PT group) were on therapy with glucocorticoids (27 wity prednisone, 2 with DF) for 870 +/- 1,128 days (range 27-4,310) RESULTS: In the PT group, DF maintained the good results previously obtained with prednisone; in this group, chest x-ray film showed improvement in 16 patients, 67Ga lung scan was better in 13, while worsening chest x-ray film findings in 1 and 67Ga lung scan in 2 was seen coincident with DF tapering.
 Respiratory function data showed a mild nonsignificant improvement.
 SACE decreased significantly from 114.6 +/- 38.7 to 91.5 +/- 37.9 nM/ml/min (p less than .05).
 In the UT group the results were better, as expected in a population where the action of corticosteroids did not influence the first observation.
 FVC increased significantly from 76.3 +/- 13.0 to 89.9 +/- 19.5 percent predicted (p less than .01); the 67Ga lung scan and chest x-ray film findings improved in all but 1 patient, and ACE dropped significantly (p less than .01) from 131.8 +/- 46.3 to 83.7 +/- 25.0.
 In both groups the side effects were mild, and only 2 patients discontinued the treatment, 1 for gastric ulcer, and the other for amenorrhea plus a 14 kg weight gain.
 CURRENT STATUS: One patient died of cancer, 9 discontinued treatment (5 because therapy was no longer necessary, 2 for the above described side effects, 2 for non-drug-related reasons), 4 dropped out and were last seen when taking DF 22.5, 18, 12 and 6 mg daily respectively.
 Twenty-six are continuing the drug on a long-term basis at the current mean daily dose of 12.1 +/- 7.3 mg (range 3-30).
 In a number of these, an attempt to discontinue DF resulted in a sarcoid relapse, and DF was restarted.
 CONCLUSION: DF is a good and safe approach to the long-term corticosteroid therapy of sarcoidosis.

"Partial atrial resection in advanced lung carcinoma with and without cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Combined pneumonectomy and partial resection of the left atrium was performed in 12 patients with advanced lung carcinoma (T3 and T4 in the new UICC classification).
 In the eight patients with a T3 lung carcinoma intrapericardial atrial resection with vascular clamping was carried out; four of the patients died within a year.
 The remaining four patients had a T4 tumour and underwent removal of the right lung and part of the left atrium under total cardiopulmonary bypass.
 One patient died shortly after the operation from cerebral and cerebellar infarction, and one died 11 months later from brain metastases.
 Two are alive and well.
 Complete resection appears to offer a chance for longer survival in patients with advanced lung carcinoma that extends directly into the intrapericardial pulmonary vessels or atrium.

"Prediction of postoperative clinical course by autologous tumor-killing activity in lung cancer patients.
 Fifty patients with primary localized lung cancer were tested at the time of surgery for the ability of their lymphocytes to kill autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells, and the assay was evaluated for prognostic significance.
 Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 27 patients (54%) demonstrated significant autologous tumor-killing activity in 6-hour 51Cr-release assays.
 Twenty-three of the 27 patients with autologous tumor-killing activity remained tumor free and survived more than 5 years after curative surgery, while all 23 who were negative for autologous tumor-killing activity relapsed by 18 months after surgery and died within 42 months after surgery.
 The differences in survival curves for the two groups were highly significant (P less than .00003).
 Autologous tumor-killing activity was not correlated with natural killer (NK) cell activity against K562 human myeloid leukemia cells or proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated with autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells in mixed culture.
 There were no differences in total survival between patients with positive results and those with negative results in tests of NK cell activity and autologous mixed lymphocyte-tumor culture reaction.
 These results indicate that autologous tumor-killing activity is a meaningful prognostic indicator and provide evidence for immunological control of tumor growth and metastasis.
 According to our preliminary data, it is unlikely that lung cancer patients who remain tumor free after 60 months of follow-up will develop recurrence or die from the disease.
 We are conducting a study to determine whether induction of autologous tumor-killing activity before surgery, by treatment with biological response modifiers,can improve the clinical outcome in patients who do not naturally have this potential.

"Frequency of deep venous thrombosis in asymptomatic patients with coronary artery bypass grafts.
 The frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has not been established.
 Therefore to estimate the frequency of clinically silent DVT, we performed ultrasound examinations of the leg veins in 29 asymptomatic CABG patients before hospital discharge.
 We used high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging.
 Fourteen (48.3%, 95% confidence interval 30.1 to 66.4%) had 20 documented leg vein thromboses, and all but one patient had DVT limited to the calf veins.
 Of the 20 thrombi 10 (50.0%) were present in the leg ipsilateral and 10 (50.0%) in the leg contralateral to the saphenous vein harvest site.
 None of the DVTs were suspected clinically.
 DVT was not associated with any local sign attributed to saphenous vein harvest such as pitting edema, incisional drainage, or local tenderness or with any putative risk factor for DVT such as cigarette use, distant history of malignancy, or varicose veins.
 Follow-up of these patients 5 to 11 months after CABG surgery showed no clinical evidence of DVT or pulmonary embolism.
 Our findings indicate that asymptomatic DVT of the calf occurs with surprisingly high frequency, 44.8% after CABG surgery.
 Future studies in patients undergoing CABG surgery should address the natural history of asymptomatic DVT, determine its clinical importance, and develop optimal strategies for prophylaxis and treatment.

"Hyaluronan in pleural effusions and in serum.
 It has been suggested that a high level of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HYA) in pleural fluid is an indicator of malignant mesothelioma.
 In 78 consecutive patients with pleural effusion of various causes the HYA concentration was measured in pleural fluid samples and in serum.
 Nine patients had malignant pleural mesothelioma, and in three of them the HYA level in pleural fluid was 100 mg/l or more.
 In 42 patients with effusions due to metastatic malignancy, the mean HYA in the pleural fluid was 75 mg/l, and in five the HYA level was above 100 mg/l.
 Cardiac insufficiency caused the effusion in 11 patients, of whom two had a level above 100 mg/l in pleural fluid.
 Four patients had a serologically confirmed viral infection and had HYA levels in pleural fluid of 8, 157, 335, and 554 mg/l, respectively.
 One patient had postinfectious effusion with an HYA level in pleural exudate of 748 mg/l, the highest in this investigation.
 Two patients had benign asbestos pleural effusions, and both had high pleural HYA levels (256 and 490 mg/l, respectively).
 The serum HYA values were much lower than in the pleural fluid, namely from 15 to 480 micrograms/l; the levels were independent of the levels in the pleural fluid.
 Thus, a high level of HYA in pleural fluid is not specific for mesothelioma but can occur in other malignant or benign diseases, and a low level does not exclude mesothelioma.

"Computed tomography-guided minithoracotomy for the resection of small peripheral pulmonary nodules.
 Small peripheral pulmonary nodules ranging in size from 1 mm to 20 mm were excised in 58 patients.
 Computed tomography was used to mark the skin overlying the nodules to minimize the surgical exposure needed for operative identification.
 The nodules were 1 cm or less in maximum diameter in 76% of the patients.
 Twenty-six patients had single nodules and 32 patients had multiple nodules.
 The preoperative diagnosis was inaccurate in 67% of the patients.
 In 61% of the patients in whom malignancy was suspected, no tumor was demonstrated.
 Conversely, of the 20 patients in whom a malignant nodule was excised, the preoperative diagnosis was correct in only 50%.
 Thirty-one patients required no further treatment apart from their biopsy and 27 required additional intervention.
 Small peripheral pulmonary nodules require biopsy for diagnosis.
 When percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy is unsuccessful, or technically difficult, a computed tomography-guided thoracotomy is an effective and minimally invasive surgical alternative.

"Pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory infections in the developing world: respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses.
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most frequently isolated pathogens in infants and children with acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) in the developed world.
 Less information is available about their importance in LRI in the developing world, but they are probably important there also.
 The pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia involves inoculation and early replication in the upper respiratory tract, followed by aspiration into the lower respiratory tract when both the mucosal and systemic immune systems are involved in a specific response.
 Both disease and recovery reflect processes of viral replication (with attendant cellular destruction) and of immune response (with attendant direct cellular destruction and release of pathogenic, along with beneficial, mediators).
 Factors predisposing to bacterial superinfection are poorly understood except in animal models.
 Conditions leading to heightened susceptibility to severe disease in the developed world are particularly common in the developing world.
 Increasing information on RSV and PIV infections in the developing world will likely point to their importance.
 Strategies for prevention of severe illnesses due to these viruses will follow from concepts elucidated through animal models and studies of infants in the developed world.

"Bronchoalveolar lavage cell data in amiodarone-associated pneumonitis. Evaluation in 22 patients.
 To assess the value of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of amiodarone-associated pneumonitis, we examined the results of BAL total and differential cell counts and phenotyping of lymphocytes in 22 patients with this lung disorder and in 33 normal subjects.
 Overall, the total cell count was found to be almost the same as that seen in control subjects; the macrophage population was significantly reduced, and the lymphocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil populations were increased in absolute number and percentage.
 When results were analyzed individually, BAL data appeared to be distributed according to two patterns.
 In the first pattern, there was no abnormal lymphocytosis.
 In the second pattern a lymphocyte alveolitis was found in percentage and in absolute number.
 This lymphocyte alveolitis was present either alone or associated with neutrophil alveolitis or with eosinophil alveolitis.
 In the first pattern, despite the normal level of the lymphocyte population, the percentage of CD4 T-lymphocytes and the CD4:CD8 T-lymphocyte ratio were significantly lowered.
 In the second pattern the CD8 T-lymphocyte count was increased in absolute number and percentage, with a low CD4:CD8 ratio.
 In six patients relavaged two to four months after amiodarone withdrawal, there was a significant fall in alveolar lymphocytosis, but the progressive increase in the neutrophil population over time seemed to be associated with the seriousness and progression of the disease.
 Finally, these findings closely resembled those obtained in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of organic dust and suggest that an underlying immunologic cell-mediated mechanism may play a role in this iatrogenic pulmonary disease.

"The evolution of single lung transplantation for emphysema. The Washington University Lung Transplant Group.
 Classic transplantation dogma mandated bilateral lung replacement for lung transplant candidates with end-stage emphysema to avoid air trapping in the native lung and subsequent crowding of the newly transplanted lung.
 During a recent 12-month period 11 patients with emphysema received a single lung transplant.
 There was no hospital mortality and only one patient had any notable degree of air trapping in the native lung.
 Substantial improvement in pulmonary function was seen as early as 2 weeks after transplantation, with significant functional improvement seen by 6 weeks, despite some residual ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
 We have demonstrated the utility and safety of single lung transplantation for patients with end-stage emphysema, and it is our operation of choice in recipients more than 50 years of age.

"Lineage-restricted clonality in biphasic solid tumors.
 Cytogenetic analysis of two pulmonary chondroid hamartomas and nine breast adenofibromas revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in both hamartomas and in four breast tumors.
 To determine lineage of the cells with chromosome aberrations, a combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic approach was developed that enabled simultaneous ascertainment of cytogenetic aberrations and immunohistochemical features in individual cells.
 Immunohistochemical/cytogenetic evaluation of one hamartoma and two adenofibromas demonstrated that neoplastic proliferation, in each case, was confined to the mesenchymal (stromal) component, whereas epithelial cells appeared to be reactive.
 Cytogenetically abnormal short-term cultures of the remaining hamartoma and another of the breast adenofibromas were composed entirely of mesenchymal elements, indicating mesenchymal clonality in those tumors as well.
 Our findings support redesignation of pulmonary chondroid hamartomas as 'pulmonary chondromas' and suggest that carcinomas developing within fibroadenomas arise from reactive epithelial proliferation.
 Combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic analysis might be useful in the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively target neoplastic populations within solid tumors.

"Perennial allergic rhinitis: clinical efficacy of a new antihistamine.
 Nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea are troublesome symptoms in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis.
 Most first-generation H1-receptor agonists achieve a 50% reduction in these symptoms, but their benefits are frequently offset by annoying anticholinergic and sedative side effects.
 Cetirizine is a major metabolite of hydroxyzine that has little anticholinergic activity and causes significantly less sedation.
 In addition, it can be given once a day.
 In placebo-controlled comparisons with terfendadine, both active drugs were comparably effective and significantly better than placebo in relieving sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal itching.
 In a multicenter, double-blind comparison with placebo, both cetirizine, 10 and 20 mg given once daily, were similarly effective and superior to placebo in reducing the overall symptoms of rhinitis.
 In another multicenter, double-blind study, cetirizine was comparable with diphenhydramine and significantly superior to placebo in reducing total symptom severity, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and ocular itching.
 The safety of cetirizine was demonstrated in all studies.

"Effect of high-frequency ventilation on the development of alveolar edema in premature monkeys at risk for hyaline membrane disease.
 High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) permits adequate gas exchange but avoids the large phasic pressure-volume excursions of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV); such avoidance may reduce the lung injury associated with hyaline membrane disease (HMD).
 We hypothesized that premature monkeys ventilated from birth with HFOV would have reduced lung injury compared to those assigned to CMV.
 Macaca nemestrina were delivered at 134 days (80% of term gestation) and ventilated from the first breath with either HFOV (n = 10) or CMV (n = 10).
 The mean airway pressure (Paw) was kept at 15 cm H2O pressure in HFOV animals; in CMV animals Paw was increased from 8 cm H2O at 2 h to 13 cm H2O at 6 h to prevent hypoxemia.
 At the conclusion of the 6-h experiment the HFOV animals had better oxygenation (p less than 0.05) and less evidence of HMD by chest radiograph (p less than 0.05).
 At 6 h of age a piece of the right middle lung lobe was removed, divided, and placed in fixatives for light and transmission electron microscopy.
 The lungs were subsequently inflated to 30 cm H2O pressure, and the right lower lobe was rapidly frozen in situ for morphometric studies.
 The proportion of peripheral lung tissue occupied by clear alveoli was greater in HFOV animals (66.3 +/- 14.8%) than in those assigned to CMV (44.2 +/- 16.9%, p less than 0.01); less alveolar debris and fluid was present in the HFOV animals (12.7 +/- 9.9%) compared with CMV animals (27.1 +/- 12.5%, p less than 0.02).

 An unusual, persistent, corregated-to-honeycombed thickening of the palms accompanied by tenderness around the fingernails was found to be a cutaneous marker for internal malignancy.
 This combination of signs and symptoms has been reported under two clinical entities: Bazex's syndrome and tripe palm.
 This paraneoplastic syndrome is of interest to head and neck surgeons due to the location of the primary tumor, the site of metastatic disease, and the ability to cure the cutaneous disease by surgical removal of the primary tumor.

"Enhanced antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells by interferon alfa.
 Tumor-draining lymph node cells from mice bearing the methylcholanthrene-induced MCA 106 tumors can be sensitized in vitro to acquire antitumor reactivity.
 We examined the effect of interferon alfa on the function of cells that underwent in vitro sensitization in adoptive immunotherapy.
 Interferon alfa increased the antitumor reactivity of in vitro sensitized cells in the treatment of MCA 106 pulmonary metastases.
 This effect was evident in irradiated mice, indicating that a host response to the interferon alfa was not required.
 Interferon alfa treatment increased class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on tumor cells and increased their susceptibility to lysis by in vitro sensitized cells.
 These results suggest that interferon alfa enhancement of adoptive immunotherapy was mediated by its effect on tumor cells.
 Interferon alfa may be a useful adjunct to the adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer.

"Response to chemotherapy does not predict survival after resection of sarcomatous pulmonary metastases.
 Between 1979 and 1988, 26 patients with pulmonary metastases from adult soft-tissue sarcomas were treated with Adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride), Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), and DTIC before metastasectomy.
 Thirty-eight thoracotomies were performed with postoperative complications in 5 patients (5/38, 13.2%) and one postoperative death (1/38, 2.6%).
 Two patients had benign lesions at thoracotomy and were excluded from further survival analysis.
 The median survival of the remaining 24 patients after thoracotomy was 18.5 +/- 5.9 months, and the actuarial 5-year survival was 22%.
 Five patients (5/24, 21%) achieved a clinically complete response with preoperative chemotherapy, but all had recurrence in the lung and underwent resection of pulmonary metastases.
 Seven patients (7/24, 29%) achieved a partial response and had residual disease resected at thoracotomy.
 Twelve patients (12/24, 50%) showed either no change or disease progression while receiving chemotherapy and were referred for resection.

"One explanation of the asthma paradox: inhibition of natural anti-inflammatory mechanism by beta 2-agonists 
 Our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma has increased substantially over the past decade.
 This has been accompanied by the introduction of a range of new drugs for the treatment of this disorder, and the usage of anti-asthma drugs is increasing.
 Despite these changes and an increased awareness of the disease, asthma remains the only ""preventable"" disease where the morbidity and mortality are still increasing in most parts of the world.
 This ""asthma paradox"" requires explanation, and this article is an attempt to provide a plausible scientific one.
 The hypothesis expresses concern that a long recognised, but little publicised, pharmacological property of the drug class most widely prescribed for the treatment of asthma, the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists--namely, the inhibition of mast-cell degranulation--may be contributing to the world wide increase in morbidity and mortality from asthma via the inhibition of a natural anti-inflammatory mechanism.

"Central pulmonary embolism with normal ventilation/perfusion scan-diagnosis by nuclear pulmonary artery flow studies.
 Pulmonary embolism, although uncommon in children, occurs in as many as 104 per 100,000 pediatric patients.
 Undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism has a high mortality rate; thus, a high index of clinical suspicion and reliable diagnostic modalities are necessary to ensure prompt and accurate diagnosis.
 We report the case of a patient with severe central pulmonary embolism with a normal ventilation-perfusion scan.
 The embolus was identified by a nuclear pulmonary flow study using dynamic imaging, which obviated the need for contrast pulmonary angiography.
 The traditional ventilation-perfusion scan may appear normal despite severe central pulmonary embolism.
 In this situation, early dynamic imaging is necessary to detect severe obstruction of the central pulmonary arteries.

"House dust mite sensitization in children and residential characteristics in a temperate region.
 House dust mite (Hdm) infestation used to be rare in Stockholm, but Hdm-sensitized children are now frequently observed, which probably indicates an increased infestation rate.
 This study was performed to elucidate determinants of Hdm sensitization in children living in the area.
 In a case-control study, 53 Hdm-sensitized children (cases), a group of non-Hdm-sensitized atopic children (N = 54), and a group of nonallergic neighborhood children (N = 53) were included.
 Mattress dust was analyzed with ELISA for content of Hdm allergens.
 Indoor humidity and temperature were measured, and questionnaire data were collected.
 Asthma was significantly more common in the Hdm-sensitized group than in the atopic control group.
 Hdm allergens were found in 40%, 19%, and 23% of the dust samples of the case group, atopic group, and neighborhood control groups, respectively.
 Only 15% of the dust samples of the Hdm-sensitized children contained Hdm allergens above the recommended threshold levels of sensitization of 2000 ng/gm of dust.
 Inadequate ventilation, which partly appeared to be a consequence of energy saving, appeared to be a risk factor for Hdm sensitization.
 This result may apply also to other temperate regions and suggests that the problem is preventable.

"Adenotonsillectomy in children with sickle cell disease.
 The pediatric patient with sickle cell disease risks having a vasoocclusive episode during adenotonsillectomy under general anesthesia.
 With proper patient selection and appropriate perioperative management, adenotonsillectomy can be accomplished safely in children with sickle cell disease.
 We review the management of 10 children with sickle hemoglobinopathies who had adenotonsillectomy.
 Indications for surgery were recurrent streptococcal infections in four and obstructive sleep apnea in six of these children.
 No complications resulted from any of these procedures, and the mean length of postoperative hospitalization was 2.4 days.
 The principal feature of preoperative management was the transfusion of red blood cells to suppress the patient's endogenous erythropoiesis and to reduce the concentration of sickle cell hemoglobin to less than 30%.
 Though a prospective, multi-institutional clinical trial will ultimately be required to settle the issue of the safest preoperative management of children with sickle cell disease, balancing the risks of transfusion-related complications against anesthesia-related complications, our experience supports the operative safety of hypertransfusion therapy in children with sickle cell disease.

 Male sex, older age, and pneumonectomy, as opposed to a lesser procedure, were associated with reduced perioperative and one-year and two-year survival.
 The adverse effect of advanced age on one-year and two-year survival following lung resection was not explained by the lower life expectancy of older individuals.
 CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims data can be used to estimate likely outcomes for elderly patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.
 Expected outcomes vary with the patient's age, sex, and the type of surgical procedure performed.

"Delivery dependence of early proximal bicarbonate reabsorption in the rat in respiratory acidosis and alkalosis.
 In the intact rat kidney, bicarbonate reabsorption in the early proximal tubule (EP) is strongly dependent on delivery.
 Independent of delivery, metabolic acidosis stimulates EP bicarbonate reabsorption.
 In this study, we investigated whether systemic pH changes induced by acute or chronic respiratory acid-base disorders also affect EP HCO3- reabsorption, independent of delivery (FLHCO3, filtered load of bicarbonate).
 Hypercapnia was induced in rats acutely (1-3 h) and chronically (4-5 d) by increasing inspired PCO2.
 Hypocapnia was induced acutely (1-3 h) by mechanical hyperventilation, and chronically (4-5 d) using hypoxemia to stimulate ventilation.
 When compared with normocapneic rats with similar FLHCO3, no stimulation of EP or overall proximal HCO3 reabsorption was found with either acute hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 74 mmHg, pH = 7.23) or chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 84 mmHg, pH = 7.31).
 Acute hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 29 mmHg, pH = 7.56) did not suppress EP or overall HCO3 reabsorption.
 Chronic hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 26 mmHg, pH = 7.54) reduced proximal HCO3 reabsorption, but this effect was reversed when FLHCO3 was increased to levels comparable to euvolemic normocapneic rats.
 Thus, when delivery is accounted for, we could find no additional stimulation of proximal bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory acidosis and, except at low delivery rates, no reduction in bicarbonate reabsorption in respiratory alkalosis.

"Expression of neurophysin-related precursor in cell membranes of a small-cell lung carcinoma.
 A monoclonal antibody (mAb L6) to a small-cell lung carcinoma surface antigen recognizes a common epitope of vasopressin-neurophysin and oxytocin-neurophysin in hypothalamic nuclei.
 We now report on the identification of a neurophysin-like precursor in human lung carcinoma (LX-1) cell membrane.
 mAb L6 immunoaffinity chromatography of solubilized membranes resulted in a single band of approximately 45 kDa.
 Western blot analysis demonstrated immunoreactivity of this band with mAb L6, anti-vasopressin, and an antibody to the vasopressin precursor, pro-pressophysin.
 N-terminal sequencing of this band demonstrated a 21-amino acid homology with the N terminus of human pro-pressophysin, and substitution of a Cys33 residue in the tumor antigen with Arg33.
 Absence of immunoreactivity with the antibodies described above in cytosolic extracts and culture medium suggests nonsecretion of processed or intact pro-pressophysin-like peptide.
 Northern analysis of LX-1 mRNA with a 30-mer to the C terminus of rat pro-pressophysin resulted in a band of approximately 1000 base pairs, 250 base pairs larger than hypothalamic message.
 In situ hybridization of LX-1 tumor-bearing nude rat brain with the same probe demonstrated specific hybridization in rat hypothalamus and xenografted tumor.
 These findings suggest expression of a pro-pressophysin-like protein in this tumor cell line that is preferentially targeted to the cell membrane.

"Etiologic and clinical evaluation of acute lower respiratory tract infections in young Argentinian children: an overview.
 This paper summarizes the first study on clinical, etiologic, and epidemiologic features of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in children in Argentina.
 A total of 1,003 children less than 5 years of age (805 inpatients and 198 outpatients) presenting with ALRI were studied during a 40-month period.
 Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), blood, urine, and throat-swab samples were collected when each child was first seen for care.
 Virologic studies were performed on the NPA by means of indirect immunofluorescence and isolation of virus in cell culture.
 Bacteriologic studies primarily were done by means of culture of blood or pleural fluid (when available); Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, however, were searched for by the use of immunofluorescence and complement-fixation testing, respectively, in paired sera.
 Respiratory syncytial virus was the most commonly isolated virus, followed by adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus.
 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by B.
 pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b.
 Overall, the patient fatality rate was 3.8% among inpatients with pneumonia or bronchiolitis.

"Temporal trends in chronic obstructive lung disease case fatality in hospitalized US veterans: 1970-1987.
 Vital statistics data have suggested that age-adjusted mortality from chronic obstructive lung diseases (CLD) is increasing.
 The present investigation has used the US Veterans Administration (VA) hospital computer database to determine whether trends in CLD case fatality follow trends in CLD population mortality.
 Data for male patients discharged from 172 VA hospitals from 1970 through 1987 were utilized.
 Patients were included if they had a CLD as a first-listed hospital discharge diagnosis, did not have any of a number of smoking-related cardiovascular or malignant diseases, and were born in the years 1900 through 1939.
 While crude case fatality for all CLD increased from 5.2 percent in 1970 to 7.4 percent in 1987, age-adjusted case fatality decreased from a peak of 8.5 percent in 1971 to 5.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 6.61 percent) in 1987.
 This trend was seen for all CLD diagnoses, including asthma.
 Age-specific case fatality decreased for each successive 5-year birth cohort, and age at death remained relatively constant over the last 14 years of the study.
 The declining case fatality could not be explained by changes in the ICD coding rubrics.
 The extent to which case fatality has been declining due to improved treatment and/or cohort-related changes in tobacco smoke exposure could not be determined definitively from the data.

"Flow cytometric DNA content analysis in neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung. Correlation with survival and histologic subtype.
 The DNA content of 53 primary and locally metastatic pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas was retrospectively determined by flow cytometric analysis of nuclei released from paraffin-embedded tissues and compared with histologic subtypes and clinical survival.
 Forty-one percent (9 of 22) of tumors classified as well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (WDNC) were aneuploid.
 In contrast, 85% (17 of 20) of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC), and 73% (8 of 11) of intermediate cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (ICNC) were aneuploid.
 DNA content was not a significant independent predictor of patient survival within each histologic subtype (P greater than 0.05 for all subtypes).
 Yet, when all cases were examined as a single group, diploid cases showed better clinical survival than cases with DNA aneuploidy (P less than 0.02).
 However, the survival advantage for diploid DNA content did not quite achieve statistical significance when only cases of limited stage disease were analyzed (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05).
 Histologic subtype was also a prognostic indicator, with WDNC cases showing a significantly longer survival than either SCNC (P less than 0.05) or ICNC (P less than 0.02), for those cases with limited-stage disease.
 These results indicate information on clinical staging and the histologic subtype are important parameters to compare with DNA content analysis in determining independent prognostic factors in neuroendocrine or small cell carcinoma of the lung.

"Symptomatic treatment versus combination chemotherapy for patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer.
 In a randomized clinical trial, 87 patients with inoperable, extensive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to receive either combination chemotherapy (cisplatin at 70 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] on day 1 and etoposide at 100 mg/m2 i.v.
 on day 1 and 200 mg/m2 orally on days 2 and 3) or symptomatic treatment.
 No statistically significant differences in survival time were found between the two treatment techniques.
 A major problem in the interpretation of the results was the use of semicurative radiation therapy (3000 to 4200 cGy) to the primary tumor and mediastinum, which was given with symptomatic intent.
 Three long-term survivors were seen in the latter group.

"Urinary N tau-methylimidazole acetic acid excretion in respiratory disease.
 N tau-methylimidazole acetic acid (N tau-MIAA) is the principal urinary metabolite of histamine.
 The basal urinary excretion rate of N tau-MIAA was determined as 0.117 +/- 0.008 (SE) mg/h, with a renal clearance for N tau-MIAA of 273 +/- 27 ml/min implying active secretion.
 After subpharmacological infusion of histamine (50 ng.kg-1.min-1 over 2 h) in five volunteers that increased plasma histamine from 0.28 +/- 0.04 to 0.71 +/- 0.15 ng/ml, urinary excretion of N tau-MIAA over 8 h was increased by less than 17% compared with a control saline infusion.
 Urinary N tau-MIAA excretion in normal controls (273 +/- 14 micrograms/mmol creatinine) was similar to that observed in patients with severe acute asthma (253 +/- 22 micrograms/mmol), antigen-induced bronchoconstriction (269 +/- 21 micrograms/mmol), seasonal allergic rhinitis (304 +/- 31 micrograms/mmol), and clinically stable bronchiectasis (270 +/- 22 micrograms/mmol).
 In contrast, large increases in metabolite excretion (greater than 7,000 micrograms/mmol creatinine) were observed in a patient with systemic mastocytosis where very high plasma histamine levels were recorded (greater than 500 ng/ml) and marked systemic hemodynamic effects occurred.
 We conclude that urinary N tau-MIAA will only be increased in pathologies where sustained hyperhistaminemia occurs and that increased local histamine production in the lung or the upper airway does not cause a measurable change in the basal urinary excretion of this metabolite.

"Life-threatening angioedema.
 Angioedema is a well-recognized edema involving the deeper layers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa.
 From July 1986 to July 1989 the authors have observed and treated 10 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Hospitals in Richmond, Virginia, with life-threatening angioedema as a complication of enalapril or captopril ingestion.
 Both drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prescribed for antihypertensive activity and the ability to improve symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure.
 We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence.
 Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature.
 This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought.

"Human immunodeficiency virus infection among homeless men in a New York City shelter. Association with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
 The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among a selected sample of 169 high-risk homeless men residing in a congregate shelter in New York City, NY, was 62%.
 Seropositivity for HIV correlated significantly with intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.4) and active tuberculosis (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.4 to 13.5).
 Most cases of active tuberculosis were among homeless men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex; and significant CD4 lymphocyte depletion was associated with active tuberculosis.
 Total time homeless correlated positively with active and latent tuberculosis infection.
 Compliance rates with return for HIV antibody test results, medications, and follow-up visits were 70%, suggesting a significant degree of knowledge, awareness, and personal concern regarding HIV infection among homeless men; yet 28% of homeless intravenous drug users continue active drug injection, despite HIV infection.
 Cohabitation in overcrowded congregate dormitories creates a risk of airborne transmission of tuberculosis, which is a common reactivation infection in HIV-seropositive homeless men.
 Medically appropriate housing should be provided to such homeless persons, and expanded HIV antibody testing, counseling, and medical services on site should be offered to residents of shelters.

"Immunoglobulin G antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are produced in the respiratory tract of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis.
 Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is a small-vessel vasculitis of unknown etiology that usually involves the upper and lower respiratory tract and the kidneys.
 Recently, an association has been made between the presence of serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and WG.
 Because WG frequently involves the lung, we sought to evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids obtained from 14 patients with WG for the presence of ANCA.
 Immunoglobulin (Ig) G ANCA was found in the BAL with the same staining patterns as observed in the serum.
 Patients with active disease had the highest serum and BAL IgG ANCA titers.
 IgA or IgM ANCA was not detected in the serum or BAL of these patients.
 Protein analysis of BAL fluid revealed that patients with active, untreated WG had approximately a fourfold elevation in total protein (41.3 versus 10.5 mg/dl), with a disproportionately greater increase in the ratio of IgG to albumin (BAL IgG index = 1.49, normal = 0.74; p = 0.027).
 The increase of the IgG index in patients with active WG suggests that local production of IgG ANCA occurs in the lungs.

"Energy balance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 A substantial number of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from gradual and significant weight loss during the natural course of their illness.
 The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of resting energy expenditure (REE) and energy intake (E-Intake) to weight loss in 80 patients with stable COPD: age (mean +/- SEM) 65 +/- 3 yr and FEV1 1.0 +/- 0.1 L.
 A total of 39 patients exhibited a continued weight loss in the previous year.
 REE measured with a ventilated hood system was significantly (p less than 0.005) higher in weight-losing compared to weight-stable patients when values were normalized for predicted metabolic rate (117 +/- 3 and 108 +/- 2%, respectively) or kg fat-free mass using bioelectrical impedance (FFM-BI): 35.0 +/- 0.8 and 31.8 +/- 0.6 kcal/kg, respectively).
 Normalized values of E-Intake were not significantly different between weight-losing and weight-stable patients.
 REE/FFM-BI correlated significantly with FEV1 (r = 0.22, p less than 0.05), maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (Plmax; r = 0.35, p less than 0.001), and E-Intake/FFM-BI (r = 0.48, p less than 0.001).
 Classification in three subgroups by severity of disease, (1) FEV1 greater than 35%, (2) FEV1 less than or equal to 35%, and (3) PaO2 less than 7.3 kPa, revealed a higher prevalence of weight loss in the more compromised groups and a significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) E-Intake in the hypoxemic patients.

"Intrathoracic complications following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: CT findings.
 The authors retrospectively reviewed computed tomographic (CT) scans of 18 patients who developed 21 episodes of intrathoracic complications after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
 Pathologic and/or microbiologic diagnoses were available for all patients.
 All patients were immunocompromised due to either graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), neutropenia, or recurrent malignancy after BMT.
 CT demonstrated diagnostically relevant findings that were not apparent at radiography in 12 of the 21 cases (57%).
 These included a ground-glass pattern in early pneumonia (n = 5); a peripheral distribution in GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic drug reaction (n = 4); cavitating lesions in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (n = 1); hemorrhagic infarcts in aspergillosis (n = 1); and mediastinal adenopathy in recurrent Hodgkin disease (n = 1).
 The authors conclude that chest CT is superior to radiography in demonstrating the presence, distribution, and extent of intrathoracic complications developing in patients after allogeneic BMT.

"Assessing clinical significance of apnea exceeding fifteen seconds with event recording.
 Using event recording, we determined how often apnea exceeding 15 seconds in duration was associated with bradycardia and how often patients with apnea resumed breathing spontaneously.
 Of 1306 documented apnea events exceeding 15 seconds (54 patients), 926 lasted 16 to 20 seconds, 262 lasted 21 to 25 seconds, and 118 exceeded 25 seconds.
 Of these episodes, 75.3% were isolated and 14.9% were associated with pulse deceleration, 4.4% with irregular transthoracic impedance, and 5.4% with bradycardia.
 Event recording provided data supporting discontinuation of monitoring in 50 of 54 patients: 36 spontaneously resumed breathing before the auditory alarm and 14 had a decreased incidence of apnea with maturation.
 Follow-up of 51 patients (three not located) showed that none had subsequent apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome.
 Our results in these older infants and children (median age 6.7 months) provide substantiation that such patients with apnea of less than 20 seconds without bradycardia do not require continued monitoring.
 Further, these data suggest that in selected older infants, longer isolated apnea may be well tolerated; however, hemoglobin saturation during sleep and the ability to resume breathing after the apnea alarm delay is prolonged should be verified.
 Our patient population had a wide age range and heterogeneity of diagnoses, and was typically free of symptoms, so these results should not be extrapolated uncritically to premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, and patients with symptomatic apnea.

"Multivariate assessment of traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease in very low birth weight neonates. The Newborn Lung Project.
 All neonates (n = 581) with birth weights less than 1501 gm admitted to seven neonatal intensive care units in Wisconsin and Iowa were candidates for a study aimed at the multivariate assessment of risk factors for chronic lung disease while controlling for baseline severity of respiratory disease.
 Data from 361 neonates were analyzed for all risk factors except fluids; only neonates weighing less than 1200 gm were included (n = 220).
 Information on traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease was abstracted.
 A total of 110 (30%) of the analyzed neonates were oxygen dependent on day 30 of life.
 The following baseline factors were associated with increased risk of oxygen dependence in a joint multivariate model: lower birth weight (odds ratio 1.4/100 gm), higher baseline severity score (odds ratio 2.7/doubling at 32 weeks gestational age), lower gestational age (odds ratio 2.4/week at severity 0), Apgar score at 1 minute (odds ratio 1.6/2 points), male gender (odds ratio 1.9), and nonblack race (odds ratio 2.2).
 After adjustment for all baseline factors, patent ductus arteriosus, ventilator pressure at 96 hours, oxygen at 96 hours, and fluid intake were associated with oxygen dependence.
 Neonates with a low baseline severity score who remained oxygen dependent had a higher intake of fluid relative to output, whereas neonates with a higher baseline severity score had higher fluid intake and output.
 Lack of weight loss was associated with increased severity but not with oxygen dependence.
 The results of this study generally confirm the significance of previously reported risk factors for chronic lung disease in a multivariate setting but show that risk factors may not have the same impact in neonates with different baseline severity.

"Comparative clinical trial of standard operative tracheostomy with percutaneous tracheostomy.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare percutaneous tracheostomy with conventional operative tracheostomy.
 DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.
 SETTING: The medical and surgical critical care units of a large, tertiary-care, private hospital.
 PATIENTS: Twenty-five male and 21 female translaryngeally intubated patients with respiratory failure, in whom tracheostomy was indicated on clinical grounds, were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
 INTERVENTIONS: The 24 patients in group 1 underwent conventional operative tracheostomy, and the 22 patients in group 2 underwent percutaneous tracheostomy.
 One patient in group 2 required tracheostomy on three separate occasions during a prolonged hospital stay.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were examined daily throughout their hospital stays for adverse events related to the tracheostomy.
 In all patients who survived until decannulation, plain tomography of the trachea was performed within 3 days of decannulation.
 Repeat physical and tomographic examinations were performed 6 and 12 wks later.
 Fifty-eight percent (14/24) of the operative tracheostomies were associated with at least one complication, compared with 25% (6/24) of the percutaneous tracheostomies (p less than .05, 95% confidence interval 7% to 59%).
 Predecannulation problems were more frequent in group 1 patients than in group 2 (46% vs.

"Should you cancel the operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection?
 Cancelling an operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is not always feasible or practical.
 Yet we know very little about the additional risk posed by a URI occurring in a child undergoing anesthesia and surgery.
 Using a large prospectively collected pediatric anesthesia database, we studied 1283 children with a preoperative URI and 20,876 children without a URI.
 We found that children with a URI were two to seven times more likely to experience respiratory-related adverse events during the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative phases of their operative experience.
 Although these children also experienced significant disruptions in temperature regulation, they were not at risk for any other deleterious events.
 The elevation in risk after URI as compared with children without a URI was not explained by differences in age, physical status scores, surgical site, and emergency or elective status.
 However, if a child had a URI and had endotracheal anesthesia, the risk of a respiratory complication increased 11-fold (95% confidence intervals 6.8, 18.1).
 We conclude that the administration of general anesthesia to children with a URI is not benign and that these children require more observation/management in all perioperative phases of their surgical procedure.

 Lewis (n = 12) and Fisher 344 (n = 13) rats were anesthetized and intubated, and intravenous and intra-arterial lines were inserted.
 IL-2 (750,000 U/kg) was infused intravenously over 2 to 4 min into seven Lewis and seven Fisher rats, and vehicle alone was administered to five Lewis and six Fisher rats.
 Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (VE), and lung resistance (RL) were measured before and every 5 min for 45 min after the infusion of IL-2.
 Lung compliance was measured before and 30 min after IL-2.
 Bronchial provocation testing with MCh was performed 45 min after the infusion of IL-2.
 Subsequently, the animals were exsanguinated, and the lungs were removed for histologic examination.

"Thoracoplasty: current application to the infected pleural space 
 Thoracoplasty, once commonly used in the management of cavitary pulmonary disease, continues to find application in the obliteration of infected pleural spaces.
 This study reports a series of 13 patients receiving thoracoplasty between 1976 and 1989.
 Five patients had chronic apical empyema spaces without prior resection of lung tissue.
 Two of the empyemas were due to tuberculosis, two were due to atypical mycobacteria, and one was due to postpneumonic empyema.
 All patients had extensive destruction of upper lobe tissue.
 Eight patients had undergone prior pulmonary resection; 3 had persistent infected spaces in the early postoperative period, 3 had development of empyemas and bronchopleural fistulas late (5 to 19 years) after pulmonary resection, and 2 had postpneumonectomy empyema.
 All patients had rigid cavity walls preventing space obliteration by rib removal alone and required concomitant resection of the thickened pleura and intercostal muscle tissues.
 Bronchopleural fistulas were present in 11 patients and were closed with adjacent nonintercostal muscle.
 All patients survived and had successful obliteration of the infected spaces with acceptable physiological and cosmetic results.
 We conclude that thoracoplasty remains a useful procedure in the management of the infected pleural space in select patients.

"Immunosuppressive acidic protein in malignant diseases. Clinical relevance?
 The immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) has been described as a tumor associated marker in some solid tumors and hematologic diseases.
 To define the clinical relevance the authors determined the serum IAP levels in 194 patients with malignancies before initiation of therapy, 14 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 28 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 23 healthy volunteers.
 Immunosuppressive acidic protein was measured by radial immunodiffusion.
 The mean value of our controls was 405 +/- 48 micrograms/ml.
 This is consistent with published data.
 The mean values for patients with malignancies varied from 554 micrograms/ml to 698 micrograms/ml.
 These are only marginally higher than those observed for the controls.
 In contrast patients with bacterial pneumonia demonstrated significantly elevated values (1038 +/- 261 micrograms/ml).

 The immunohistochemical distribution and concentrations of tumor-antigen 4 (TA-4) in tissues and serum were determined in patients with benign and malignant diseases, including 27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 15 in the lung and 12 in the esophagus).
 Tumor-antigen 4 immunoreactivity was present in the cytoplasm of many SCC tissues, especially in the hyperparakeratotic region, and in the cytoplasm of differentiated squamous cells of the intermediate layer of normal epithelia of various organs, but not in those of other types of lung cancers or benign pulmonary diseases.
 Consistent with the results of immunostaining, the TA-4 concentrations in SCC tissues of the lung, esophagus, and normal squamous epithelia were much higher than in those of lung cancer other than SCC, benign pulmonary diseases, normal lung, and submandibular gland tissues.
 The TA-4 concentration in SCC tissue tended to increase with increasing grades of differentiation.
 Serum TA-4 was elevated in 15 of 27 patients with SCC but in no patients with other types of lung cancer or benign diseases.
 These results indicate that TA-4 is an antigen related to the differentiation of squamous cells and that tumor cells of SCC can release a large amount of TA-4 into circulation whereas normal squamous epithelia cannot.

 The patients were aged 15-67 years in 1968 and had a scoliotic angle of 10-190 degrees and a vital capacity of 1.0-6.0 litres.
 Spirometric values and scoliotic angles were determined in 1968 and 1988, and arterial blood gas tensions in 1988.
 The decline in spirometric values over the 20 years was of the same magnitude as the predicted decline due to aging.
 Arterial blood gas tensions in 1988 were strongly correlated with the scoliotic angles and spirometric indices recorded in 1968.
 Hypoxaemia and hypercapnia was seen in four patients in 1988 (then aged 43-67 years) and these were the four patients who had a vital capacity below 43% predicted in 1968.
 The remaining 20 patients had blood gas values within normal limits.
 Two further patients had died from respiratory failure before 1988, so a total of six patients had developed respiratory failure.
 In a multiple logistic analysis vital capacity expressed as % predicted in 1968 was the strongest predictor of the development of respiratory failure, followed by the scoliotic angle.
 Respiratory failure occurred only in patients who had a vital capacity below 45% predicted in 1968 and an angle greater than 110 degrees.
 Thus respiratory failure develops in adults with scoliosis with a large angle and a low vital capacity when normal aging reduces the ventilatory capacity further.
 Such individuals merit close follow up.

"Benign pleural effusions in long-standing diabetes mellitus.
 We studied intractable pleural effusions in five patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus and an additional 40 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction to determine whether the frequency of pleural effusions is increased in diabetic patients and, if so, the relation of pleural effusions to left ventricular dysfunction.
 In our initial observations, effusions were benign, were not always associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), and reaccumulated following thoracentesis.
 Effusions associated with CHF persisted despite medical treatment and improvement of CHF.
 In our study of 40 patients with similar degrees of left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of pleural effusions in diabetic patients was 83 percent and in our nondiabetic patients was 14 percent (p less than 0.001).
 We conclude that pleural effusions occur more commonly in diabetic than nondiabetic patients and may be related to left ventricular dysfunction and possibly other factors leading to increased effusion.

"Dysphagia in psychiatric patients: clinical and videofluoroscopic study.
 Deaths due to airway obstruction are more common in psychiatric inpatients than in the normal population.
 A dysphagia program was started in a 400 bed Massachusetts psychiatric hospital after 4 patients in 1 year died from asphyxia.
 In the year after the program was started, there were no deaths; however, 28 patients experienced 32 choking incidents.
 The 28 patients received clinical evaluations by speech pathologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and internists.
 Of the incidents, 55% required use of the Heimlich maneuver to open the airway.
 Choking incidents could be classified into five types based on results of clinical examination: bradykinetic, dyskinetic, fast eating syndrome, paralytic, and medical.
 Twenty-one of the 28 patients were studied by videofluoroscopy and 86% of the videos were abnormal, showing aspiration in eight, webs in five, and delay in the oral phase in five.
 Patients with bradykinetic dysphagia (secondary to neuroleptic-induced extra-pyramidal syndrome [EPS]) and paralytic dysphagia appeared to experience a more severe form of choking.

"Tracheal reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene graft in dogs.
 Use of prosthetic materials for long-segment tracheal reconstruction has been limited owing to infection, graft migration, ingrowth of fibrous tissue, and stenosis.
 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is flexible and porous, and it may resist infection more than previously used materials.
 We evaluated PTFE for use in long-segment tracheal reconstruction.
 A 5-cm segment of trachea was resected in 9 dogs and replaced with a 20-mm reinforced PTFE graft using 4-0 Vicryl sutures.
 In 2 control dogs, one tracheal arch was resected and a primary anastomosis was performed.
 The animals were followed up with weekly bronchoscopy and endoscopic photography.
 Euthanasia was performed at 16 weeks or when signs of respiratory distress developed.
 At postmorten examination, the anastomoses were examined grossly and with light and scanning electron microscopy.
 In all 9 dogs that underwent tracheal replacement with PTFE, granulation tissue developed at the anastomoses resulting in airway obstruction after 3 to 8 weeks.
 No epithelial growth occurred over the graft between the anastomoses.
 The control animals did well.
 We conclude that granulation tissue formation at the anastomosis and the lack of respiratory epithelial ingrowth across the graft makes PTFE unsuitable for long-segment tracheal reconstruction.

"Effects of alterations in pulmonary function and sleep variables on survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
 Breathing abnormalities and nocturnal hypoventilation occur in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
 A prospective study was undertaken to determine the relationship of pulmonary function test abnormalities with quality of sleep and survival in 21 patients with ALS.
 Results of spirometry including determination of maximal respiratory pressures and arterial blood gases were compared with several formal polysomnographic variables and then also with 18-month survival.
 The patients had mild to moderate pulmonary function deficits, but the quality of sleep was best related to age (mean age, 58.5 years).
 The results of pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas measurements did not correlate well with the presence of nocturnal breathing events or survival time, but the maximal inspiratory pressure was 86% sensitive for predicting the presence of a nocturnal oxygen saturation nadir of 80% or less and 100% sensitive for predicting 18-month survival.
 Although obstructive breathing events occurred, the primary explanation for the decline in nocturnal oxygen saturation was hypoventilation.
 We conclude that routine pulmonary function tests may be useful for screening for reductions in nocturnal oxygen saturation and also may have prognostic value.
 Further studies may determine whether treatment of nocturnal hypoventilation will have an effect on survival in patients with ALS who have breathing impairment.

"Pharyngeal function and snoring characteristics in apneic and nonapneic snorers.
 Abnormalities in pharyngeal function, manifested even when the patients are awake, are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea.
 Tests of awake pharyngeal function continue to stimulate interest because it is hoped that they may allow physicians to distinguish patients with sleep apnea from those without it, and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary sleep studies.
 We elected to study two measures of pharyngeal function: changes in pharyngeal area with lung volume (PLVD) and changes in pharyngeal area in response to externally applied positive pressure, i.e., pharyngeal distensibility (Cph).
 Both measurements have been employed for assessment of pharyngeal function, and both are thought to reflect pharyngeal ""floppiness."" Measurement of PLVD is technically very simple, whereas the measurement of Cph is technically more complex.
 If the two measurements are highly correlated, it might be possible to replace the technically more difficult one by the simpler one.
 Consequently, the purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to examine the relationship between pharyngeal distensibility and lung volume dependence of pharyngeal area, and second, to compare these parameters in a large group of confirmed snorers with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
 We studied 75 unselected patients referred for the investigation of snoring and suspected sleep apnea.
 All patients had nocturnal polysomnography, pulmonary function tests, and measurement of pharyngeal areas at TLC, FRC, and residual volume (RV) employing the acoustic reflection technique.
 The area measurement at FRC was performed at zero and at 4.1 cm H2O positive airway pressure to calculate pharyngeal distensibility.

"Immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency and predisposition to infection in Down's syndrome.
 Serum immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses were measured in 26 children with Down's syndrome using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and monoclonal antibodies.
 Eighteen (69%) of the children had increased susceptibility to infection.
 None of the children had deficiencies of total IgG and IgM, and only one had an IgA deficiency.
 IgG4 deficiency was diagnosed in 14 (54%) children.
 One child had a deficiency of IgG2.
 There were no children with deficiencies of either IgG1 or IgG3.
 There was a significant correlation between IgG subclass deficiency and predisposition to infection (P less than 0.05).
 Ninety percent of the patients with severe infections had low IgG4 whereas only 25% of those with no infections had low concentrations of IgG4.
 These results suggest that it is important to screen patients with Down's syndrome who have frequent systemic or respiratory infections for IgG subclass deficiencies because this may not be apparent from the assay of total IgG.

"Acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients with diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
 This study focused on 401 children less than 5 years old who were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and who were investigated for the presence of both bacterial and viral respiratory tract pathogens as well as for selected diarrheal pathogens.
 The most common manifestations of ALRI were pneumonia (374 cases), bronchiolitis (12 cases), and tracheobronchitis (11 cases).
 The majority (77%) of the illnesses were in children less than 2 years of age, and 88% of the children were malnourished.
 A respiratory tract pathogen was identified in 30% of the patients, and a diarrheal pathogen was identified in 34%.
 The overall case-fatality rate in children with ALRI and diarrhea was 8%.
 The case-fatality rate was 14% in children with bacterial pneumonia and diarrhea, 3% in those with viral pneumonia and diarrhea, and 14% in malnourished children with shigellosis and ALRI.
 The most common respiratory tract pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza viruses, and Haemophilus influenzae type b.

"The effect of sulindac on the abnormal cough reflex associated with dry cough.
 In order to determine the possible role of prostaglandins in the abnormal cough reflex in patients with dry cough, the effects of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor on cough symptoms were examined.
 This was measured by a cough symptom score and by the cough reflex sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin in a double blind, randomized, cross-over study comparing the effects of placebo with sulindac, 200 mg daily for 1 week.
 We studied six hypertensive patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-associated cough and six patients with an idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, all of whom had an increase in the sensitivity of the cough reflex.
 There was no change in blood pressure control in the hypertensive patients during sulindac therapy.
 The patients with the angiotensin converting enzyme-associated cough had a significant reduction in the cough symptom score and also a significant increase in the dose of capsaicin causing two or more coughs (threshold sensitivity) and that causing five or more coughs (near maximum response) during sulindac therapy as compared to placebo.
 In those patients with idiopathic, dry, unproductive cough, sulindac did not alter the symptom of cough or the cough reflex response to capsaicin.
 These results suggest that prostaglandins may be involved in cough associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy, but are less likely to be important in the pathogenesis of more common dry coughs of unknown cause.

"The value of portable chest roentgenography in adult respiratory distress syndrome. Comparison with computed tomography.
 In 17 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, we used data derived from computed tomographic (CT) scan densitometric analysis to validate the value of portable chest roentgenograms in objectively estimating the amount of pulmonary edema.
 Chest roentgenograms and CT scans were taken in the same ventilatory conditions (apnea at 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]); blood gas samples and hemodynamic parameters were collected at the same time.
 Roentgenographic analysis was undertaken by independent observers using two standardized scoring systems proposed in the literature.
 CT scan analysis was performed using the CT number frequency distribution and the gas lung volume (measured by helium dilution technique) to estimate quantitatively the lung density, the lung weight, and the percentage of normally aerated and nonaerated tissue.
 Knowing the mean CT number of the pulmonary parenchyma in a group of normal subjects, we also inferred the ideal lung weight expected in the study population and computed the excess tissue mass as the difference between actual and ideal lung weight.
 Both the roentgenographic scoring systems showed direct correlation with the pulmonary impairment as detected by CT scan densitometric analysis (CT number, percentage of nonaerated tissue, lung weight, and excess tissue mass; p less than 0.01) and inverse relation with the percentage of normally aerated tissue (p less than 0.01).
 We also found a relationship between roentgenographic scores and the impairment in gas exchange as detected by shunt fraction (p less than 0.05).
 We conclude that standardized reading of portable chest roentgenograms by means of scoring tables is a valuable tool in estimating the amount of pulmonary edema in a patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"Body composition by bioelectrical-impedance analysis compared with deuterium dilution and skinfold anthropometry in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Body composition is an important measure of nutritional status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 We generated a regression model for bioelectrical impedance (BI) by using deuterium dilution (2H2O) as a reference method in 32 COPD patients, aged 63 +/- 9 y (mean +/- SD), in stable pulmonary and cardiac condition.
 Height squared divided by resistance (Ht2/Res) correlated well with total body water (TBW) as measured by 2H2O (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001, SEE = 1.9 L).
 The best-fitting regression equation to predict TBW comprised Ht2/Res and body weight (r2 = 0.89, SEE = 1.8 L, P less than 0.001).
 BI-predicted TBW was used to estimate BI-fat-free mass (FFM) that was compared with skinfold-thickness-based FFM predictions (Anthr-FFM).
 Relative to BI-FFM a significant overestimation of 4.4 +/- 0.8 kg was found by Anthr-FFM.
 Our results suggest that BI is a useful measure of body composition in patients with severe COPD.

"The diagnostic utility of the antibody-coated bacteria test in intubated patients.
 PURPOSE: Pilot study to determine if the presence of antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) in sputum specimens obtained from endotracheal tube suctioning would aid in the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: All endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated patients for a two-month period were recruited for study.
 The diagnosis of LRTI was based on a clinical suspicion sufficient enough to start or change antibiotic therapy.
 Specimens were obtained by blind endotracheal tube suctioning.
 After processing, sputum smears were stained with fluorescein-labelled antibody to the Fc portion of IgG, IgM, and IgA.
 More than five fluorescein-labelled bacteria per oil immersion field were considered positive smears.
 RESULTS: Seventy-one specimens were obtained from 36 patients.
 Eighteen specimens were positive in 12 patients, all of whom had LRTI.
 No specimen was positive in patients not diagnosed as having LRTI.
 The ACB test was positive in 12 of 25 patients with LRTI.
 Patients with LRTI but negative ACB were more likely to have received prior antibiotic therapy (p less than 0.001).
 ACB was positive prior to the clinical diagnosis of LRTI in seven of nine patients (av 4.1 days, range 2-6 days) and converted to negative in three specimens obtained seven or more days after starting appropriate antibiotics, while in three specimens it remained positive three-six days post treatment initiation.
 CONCLUSIONS: The ACB test appears to be highly specific for the presence of LRTI in intubated patients.
 Sensitivity of the test may be adversely affected by prior antibiotic therapy.
 A positive ACB test may predict the subsequent development of LRTI.
 Further study is warranted.

"Permeability pulmonary edema following lung resection.
 The etiology of edema associated with pulmonary resection was investigated in five patients during the immediate postoperative period.
 Three patients received pneumonectomy while two patients had one lobe resected.
 All patients suffered from severe respiratory distress and had x-ray evidence of diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema within 12 hours of surgery.
 Hemodynamic data were obtained with radial and pulmonary artery catheters.
 Edema fluid was obtained along with blood samples for simultaneous determination of protein and albumin content.
 All patients studied had normal or high cardiac output, normal cardiac filling pressures, and edema fluid protein to serum protein ratio of 0.6 or greater suggestive of permeability changes contributing to edema fluid accumulation.
 Calculated shunt fraction exceeded 25 percent in all patients.
 Pulmonary edema has been noted in patients following pulmonary resection in the early postoperative period.
 In patients reviewed here, two factors appeared to be significant.
 First is an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure associated with passage of a normal to high cardiac output in a reduced volume pulmonary vascular bed.
 The second factor, as demonstrated by protein content in the edema fluid, is injury to the alveolar capillary membrane.

"Mineral spirits inhalation associated with hemolysis, pulmonary edema, and ventricular fibrillation.
 A previously healthy 42-year-old woman developed severe dyspnea, chest discomfort, and malaise several hours after prolonged exposure to concentrated vapors from mineral spirits.

 Her hospital course included slowly resolving cardiac abnormalities, amnesia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, abrupt hemolytic anemia, sustained rhabdomyolysis, and other metabolic abnormalities.
 It is highly probable that this syndrome represented acute and near-lethal toxicity caused by the inhalational exposure to the petroleum distillate known as mineral spirits.
 It is important that physicians be aware of this syndrome in order to recognize it on presentation and to warn patients of the risk of such toxic exposure.

"Evaluation of epiglottoplasty as treatment for severe laryngomalacia [published erratum appears in J Pediatr 1991 Jan;118(1):168]
 Six patients with severe laryngomalacia underwent epiglottoplasty.
 Four of these patients had life-threatening episodes of airway obstruction before surgery; of these, two had required tracheal intubation and one had required cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
 Two patients had failure to thrive and two had cor pulmonale.
 Patients had required a mean of two hospitalizations related to upper airway obstruction.
 We performed polysomnography during a daytime nap, both before and after epiglottoplasty, in all patients.
 Respiratory effort, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure were monitored with continuous electrocardiograms and electrooculograms.
 All patients had abnormal polysomnograms preoperatively.
 Six patients had obstructive apnea, four had hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% while breathing room air), and four had hypoventilation (end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure greater than 45 mm Hg) before epiglottoplasty.
 Mean age (+/- SEM) at epiglottoplasty was 10.3 +/- 5.3 months.
 No patients had surgical complications.
 An endotracheal tube was in place for 25 +/- 7 hours postoperatively, and patients were discharged 4 +/- 1 days postoperatively.
 Polysomnography performed 2.8 +/- 1.0 months after surgery showed that all patients had improved.
 Two patients had residual, mild episodes of obstructive apnea, and one patient had mild hypoventilation and desaturation.
 No patient had further life-threatening events or required further hospitalizations after epiglottoplasty.
 We conclude that epiglottoplasty is an effective and safe treatment for a selected group of patients with severe laryngomalacia.

"The role of the chest roentgenogram in febrile neutropenic patients.
 In a retrospective review of patients with neutropenia and fever, we sought to determine how often roentgenograms detected pulmonary disease, especially pneumonia, not suggested by signs and symptoms.
 Further, we sought to determine how often therapy was changed as a result of roentgenographic findings.
 Overall, 41 (22%) of 187 chest roentgenograms obtained during initial febrile episodes, recurrent fevers, or persistent fevers were abnormal.
 While most patients had signs and symptoms suggesting the presence of pulmonary disease, 17% had roentgenographic abnormalities detected in the absence of such findings.
 During initial febrile episodes, therapy was not changed in response to findings on the chest roentgenogram.
 However, during episodes of persistent or recurrent fever, findings on chest roentgenograms led to changes in therapy in eight (61%) of 13 episodes of which six (40%) resulted in clinical improvement.
 Chest roentgenograms were therefore found to be an important diagnostic tool in evaluating recurrent or persistent fever in the neutropenic patient but of little use during initial febrile episodes.

"Total respiratory resistance and reactance in patients with asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.
 A comparison was made of total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) determined between 6 and 26 Hz by means of a forced oscillation technique in 27 patients with asthma (group A), 28 patients with chronic bronchitis (group B), and 20 patients with emphysema (group E) to examine whether the method can provide data capable of distinguishing among these diseases.
 The three groups demonstrated a similar reduction in the FEV1.
 In addition, static and dynamic lung volumes, maximal expiratory flows, diffusing capacity for CO, airway resistance (Raw), and elastic lung recoil were measured.
 The observed alterations of Rrs and Xrs consisted of an increase in Rrs, a decrease in Rrs with frequency, and a decrease in Xrs.
 However, significant differences were found between the three groups: Rrs at 6 Hz and average Rrs were most increased in group A, whereas the negative frequency dependence of Rrs and the decrease in Xrs were least pronounced in group E.
 In all groups Rrs at 6 Hz, the average slope of Rrs, and the average level of Xrs were tightly interrelated and showed in addition a high correlation with airway resistance; the correlations with FEV1 were less satisfactory.
 Discriminant analysis performed on the complete set of data, excluding diffusing capacity and elastic lung recoil, which were used as selection criteria, demonstrated that forced oscillation parameters were the most important factors discriminating among the groups.

"Washed human platelets prevent ischemia-reperfusion edema in isolated rabbit lungs.
 Washed human platelets prevent edema formation in isolated rabbit lungs infused with xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that injures endothelial membranes by generating extracellular oxidants.
 We hypothesized that platelets would similarly preserve membrane permeability in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model that perturbs endothelial cells by the generation of intracellular oxidants.
 Isolated perfused rabbit lungs (IPL) were exposed to warm ischemia-reperfusion to cause lung edema.
 The infusion of washed human platelets (1.05 +/- 0.02 x 10(10) cells) prevented edema formation as measured by lung weight gain, wet-to-dry lung weight ratios, histological edema, and preservation of paraendothelial cell tight junctions.
 Inhibition of the platelet glutathione redox cycle with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, dehydroepiandrosterone, or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene interfered with platelet protective effects.
 In contrast, inhibition of platelet catalase with aminotriazole and H2O2 had no effect on platelet protection.
 Lung tissue malonyldialdehyde concentrations were similar in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion with or without the infusion of platelets.
 These results indicate that platelet attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion lung edema depends on platelet glutathione redox cycle antioxidants but not platelet catalase.

"Bronchial responsiveness is not increased by bronchoalveolar and bronchial lavage performed after allergen challenge.
 Nonspecific bronchial responsiveness was studied in 23 allergic patients with a history of rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar and bronchial lavage (BAL-BL) 4h (Group A) or 24 h (Group B) after an allergen inhalation challenge.
 In all patients, the dose of methacholine causing an FEV1 fall of 15% (PD15) was determined at baseline, 24 h before allergen challenge.
 Methacholine bronchial challenge was repeated 1 h before BAL-BL in patients of both groups and again 12 to 14 h after BAL-BL in Group A and 24 h after BAL-BL in Group B.
 In patients of Group A, the values of methacholine PD15 after BAL-BL were not significantly different from those determined before BAL-BL.
 This was also the case in patients in whom bronchial responsiveness was increased after allergen challenge.
 In patients of Group B, methacholine PD15 was significantly decreased after allergen challenge, and this decrease was correlated with the occurrence and the severity of the late asthmatic reaction.
 Even in patients who showed dual asthmatic reactions and an increased responsiveness after allergen challenge, methacholine PD15 was not further decreased after BAL-BL.
 These data support the safety of a procedure combining bronchial allergen challenge with BAL-BL, which can be used for studies on the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma.

 Total normothermic venoarterial bypass was established in 6 healthy pigs over a period of 18 hours.
 A heparin-coated closed extracorporeal system was used and no heparin was administered systemically.
 During the bypass period the main pulmonary artery was occluded and the heart was maintained in a beating state.
 All the animals maintained stable hemodynamics and normal blood gases during the entire period of bypass.
 In the postbypass period, the central hemodynamics continued to be stable while the arterial oxygen tension (inspired oxygen fraction = 0.21) decreased significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05).
 The total body oxygen uptake, on the other hand, remained unaltered.
 All the animals died within 4 hours after weaning off the venoarterial bypass circuit on account of pulmonary edema in 2 and cardiac arrest in 4.
 Death was preceded by progressive pulmonary hypertension and lactacidosis in all the animals.
 Histological examination of the lungs showed pulmonary parenchymal damage ranging from interstitial edema to intraalveolar hemorrhage and parenchymal necrosis involving more than 80% of the pulmonary parenchyma.

"Intravenous bolus of prednisolone decreases 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation in the rat model of acid aspiration.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that the effect of steroids on hydrochloric acid aspiration may be involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, we investigated the effects of an iv bolus of prednisolone on the metabolism of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-dehydro-TxB2) in the rat model of acid aspiration.
 Wistar rats were randomly selected for three groups and treated with either a) an iv bolus of saline after intratracheal injection of saline (control group), b) an iv bolus of saline after intratracheal injection of acid (acid-saline group), or c) an iv bolus of prednisolone after intratracheal injection of acid (acid-prednisolone group).
 The concentrations of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 11-dehydro-TxB2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by radioimmunoassay.
 RESULTS: The concentration of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of either acid-saline group (804 +/- 129 pg/mL) or acid-prednisolone group (748 +/- 112 pg/mL) was significantly greater than that of the control group (143 +/- 27 pg/mL, p less than .01) 1 hr after the administration.
 The iv bolus of prednisolone caused a significant decrease in 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (acid-saline group 1027 +/- 43 pg/mL; acid-prednisolone group 514 +/- 62 pg/mL; p less than .01) and cell counts of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 48 hrs after intratracheal injection of acid, while there was no significant change in 11-dehydro-TxB2.
 CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that corticosteroid administration may contribute to the inhibition of the inflammatory process of lungs after acid aspiration by decreasing the release of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the distal lung unit.

"Aztreonam-induced myelosuppression during treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.
 Aztreonam is a synthetic, monobactam antibiotic structurally related to the beta-lactam class of drugs.
 It has inhibitory activity against many aerobic gram-negative bacteria, although it does not inhibit gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria.
 Administration of aztreonam occasionally is associated with minimal and transient adverse effects.
 This case report describes a patient we believe experienced bone marrow suppression approximately ten days after aztreonam was given for treatment of pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 This untoward effect primarily was manifested as neutropenia, although normochromic, normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia were noted as well.
 One week after aztreonam was discontinued, the patient's bone marrow suppression resolved spontaneously.
 Although the mechanism responsible for myelosuppression is unclear, aztreonam may be implicated as the offending agent based on the temporal relationship between the development of neutropenia and its administration, and the resolution of neutropenia upon its discontinuation.

 In this health care setting, pneumonia and serious urinary tract infection are common among patients.
 These infections can now often be treated successfully with use of parenteral antibiotic therapy in the nursing home, thereby not subjecting the patient to the added stress of hospitalization.
 However, the physician's decision to use parenteral antibiotic therapy for the nursing home resident is complex and must be guided by the patient's condition, the wishes of the patient and family, the frequent shortage of professional staff, and the cost of the drug.
 Nevertheless, with these factors in mind, compassionate, high-quality care can often be provided in the nursing home in a cost-effective fashion.

"The applications of PET in clinical oncology.
 With the advent of a new generation of PET scanners that have introduced whole-body PET to the clinical setting, there is now more interest in developing protocols for the evaluation of both intracranial and somatic cancers.
 The value of PET in clinical oncology has been demonstrated with studies in a variety of cancers including colorectal carcinomas, lung tumors, head and neck tumors, primary and metastatic brain tumors, breast carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma, bone cancers, and other soft-tissue cancers.
 A summary of current clinical applications of PET in oncology is presented with special attention to colorectal, lung, and intracranial neoplasms since the majority of clinical trials have focused on these cancers.
 A variety of radiopharmaceuticals are described that are currently included in clinical tumor-imaging protocols, including metabolic substrates such as fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and carbon-11-methionine, and analogs of chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorine-18-fluorouracil and fluoroestradiol.
 An attempt is also made to include examples of clinical trials that demonstrate response to therapeutic intervention.
 The increasing number of oncologic PET studies reflects the growing interest in functional imaging in oncology.

"Morphologic changes in lungs of anesthetized sheep following intravenous infusion of recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha.
 Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a monokine released in response to endotoxin and has been suggested as a primary mediator of endotoxic shock.
 We have recently demonstrated that infusion of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF alpha) into sheep elicits a physiologic response in the lung that closely resembles endotoxemia.
 The present study examines the morphologic changes that accompany these alterations in pulmonary physiology.
 Five anesthetized, open-chest sheep received 0.01 mg/kg of protein (2.24 x 10(7) U rTNF alpha/mg) intravenously over 30 min.
 Lung biopsy tissue for light and electron microscopy was obtained from random lobes 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after beginning the infusion.
 Pulmonary (Ppa) and systemic arterial pressures, cardiac output, and peripheral blood leukocyte number and differential counts were monitored throughout the study.
 Three control animals were treated in a similar manner but received either saline (n = 1) or rTNF alpha denatured by boiling for 30 min (n = 2).
 rTNF alpha caused an early increase in Ppa and peripheral blood leukopenia.
 Light microscopy revealed a threefold increase in the number of granulocytes per 100 alveolar profiles by 30 min and a fivefold increase by 2 h.
 From 60 min, increased alveolar wall thickness, red cell congestion, and peribronchovascular edema were apparent; from 2 h, there was increased cellularity of the alveolar walls and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular connective tissue.
 Electron microscopy revealed damage to alveolar Type I and II pneumonocytes and progressive endothelial injury from 30 min.

"Differential adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to human respiratory epithelial cells in primary culture.
 Human nasal polyps in outgrowth culture were used to study the Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion to respiratory cells.
 By scanning electron microscopy, P.
 aeruginosa were seen associated with ciliated cells, but by transmission electron microscopy, bacteria were never seen at the interciliary spaces or attached along cilia, but were identified trapped at the extremities of cilia, usually as bacterial aggregates.
 A fibronectin-containing fibrillar material was seen associated with aggregated bacteria.
 By time-lapse video microscopy, bacteria were seen to aggregate in the culture medium following their addition to the culture wells.
 Progressively, these aggregates were trapped by cilia or attached to migrating cells of a lower cell layer that protruded beneath the upper layer cells, at the outgrowth periphery.
 P.
 aeruginosa adhesion to these lower cell layer migrating cells was significantly higher than to ciliated or nonciliated cells of the upper cell layer.
 Migrating cells were intensely labeled by the complexes Con A and arachis hypogea agglutinin (PNA)-FITC, in contrast to the other cells.
 The percentage of PNA-labeled cells with attached bacteria was significantly higher than that without bacteria.
 These results suggest that changes of cell surface glycoconjugates related with cell migration may favor P.
 aeruginosa adhesion to respiratory cells.

"Efficacy of daily routine chest radiographs in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients 
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of daily routine chest radiographs in intubated, mechanically ventilated patients.
 DESIGN: With approval of our Institutional Review Board, data were collected prospectively to compare bedside clinical assessment of the patient with the routine chest radiograph in determining the occurrence of new findings.
 Before review of the daily chest film, patients underwent careful evaluation of clinical and physiologic variables by critical care physicians, who then documented the new findings and the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions required.
 These results were compared with the interpretations of the daily chest film by radiologists blinded to the clinical assessment.
 Correlations were made of the new major (requiring immediate intervention) and new minor (abnormal but not requiring immediate intervention) findings noted by clinical assessment and chest radiography.
 SETTING: This study was conducted in a ten-bed medical/surgical ICU admitting 650 to 750 patients/yr, a majority of whom require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
 PATIENTS: Seventy-seven episodes of intubation and mechanical ventilation in 74 patients were evaluated.
 Only patients with translaryngeal intubation and a requirement for mechanical ventilation beyond 24 hrs were considered for inclusion in this study.
 Major admitting diagnoses included malignancy, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, liver failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 INTERVENTIONS: Specific interventions were not made by study design; instead, clinical practice with and without the routine chest radiograph was compared.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The measure of comparison between the chest radiograph and clinical assessment was the correlation between the two for a number of major and minor findings defined in advance.
 A total of 538 chest radiographs were examined; of these, 354 (65.8%) did not disclose either new major or new minor findings as defined.
 One hundred sixty-three radiographs disclosed only new minor findings, 40.5% of which were anticipated by bedside assessment.
 However, in 13 (17.6%, 95% confidence interval 9% to 26%) of our 74 patients, new major findings were discovered only by chest radiography.
 CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that, while a large percentage of radiographs will not disclose new findings, routine daily studies have a substantial impact on the management of intubated, mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU.
 These findings support the use of daily chest radiographs in critically ill patients.

 The clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic features of 59 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Kampala, Uganda were studied and correlated with the serologic reactivity to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of these patients.
 Two-thirds of the patients with tuberculosis were HIV-seropositive.
 Histories of fever and weight loss were more prominent in HIV-seropositive patients, and perihilar and basilar infiltrative diseases were more frequently seen in HIV-seropositive patients.
 Although all patients responded similarly to drug therapy, cutaneous drug reactions were seen in nearly one-third of HIV-seropositive patients receiving thiacetazone.

"Effect of enlarged adenoids on arterial blood gases in children.
 The enlarged adenoid is a common disorder in children resulting in nasopharyngeal obstruction.
 Many authors suggest that increased nasal resistance to respiration may cause disturbances in the pulmonary ventilation and carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea and/or cardiopulmonary syndrome.
 This study comprised 30 children complaining of long-standing nasal obstruction due to enlarged adenoids.
 Adenoidectomy was performed and the arterial blood gases were measured before and one month after surgery.
 Twelve normal children were also included as controls.
 Statistical evaluation of the results showed that O2 saturation and arterial O2 tension (PaO2) were significantly low before the operation, and increased significantly after surgery.
 Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was insignificantly low before operation, but decreased significantly after adenoidectomy.
 It was concluded that enlarged adenoid may be associated with ventilatory impairment which is reversible after adenoidectomy.

"Benjamin Felson lecture. Chronic interstitial lung disease of unknown cause: a new classification based on pathogenesis.
 Chronic interstitial lung disease of unknown cause is usually classified on the basis of descriptive histology.
 In this lecture, a recently published series of 910 cases of chronic interstitial lung disease is used to show that these descriptive terms can be reorganized into a classification that is based on inflammatory and neoplastic processes.
 The proposed classification includes three major diagnostic categories, two of which are based on the chronic inflammatory response and a third that results from infiltration of the interstitial space by neoplastic cells of either a benign, borderline, or frankly malignant nature.
 An argument is presented that the steps involved in the development of the endstage of chronic interstitial lung disease are similar in all three groups.
 The advantage of this new classification is that it shifts the emphasis from descriptive terminology to pathogenesis, which provides a more critical basis for investigation of the causes of these diseases.

"Smoking and symptom effects on the curves of lung function growth and decline.
 Numerous studies have examined the natural time course of human lung function growth and decline throughout life.
 In most of these studies the investigators used statistical models that required a priori assumptions concerning the underlying form or structure of the lung function data, thus introducing possible biases.
 In this study we used recently developed nonparametric regression (spline) techniques to describe the evolution of lung function measures with age.
 This procedure yields an optimally fitted smooth curve through the data and estimates of the process velocity and does not require assumptions concerning the underlying shape of the data curves.
 The lung function growth-velocity curves are used to estimate the age of growth cessation.
 This technique was applied to the FVC, FEV1, and the FEV1/FVC ratios of 1,295 females and 1,230 males who were tested in at least one of the first nine surveys of the Tucson epidemiologic study of airway obstructive diseases.
 Data were analyzed stratified according to gender, smoking status, and respiratory symptoms or diseases.
 The results indicate large differences between the fitted FEV1 and FEV1/FVC smoothed curves of the various subgroups compared with asymptomatic nonsmokers.
 These differences were most pronounced in the adult symptomatic smokers, who had higher rates of lung function loss that also began at earlier ages, for both sexes.
 No significant differences were observed between asymptomatic and symptomatic nonsmokers, most likely because of the reduced number of symptomatic nonsmokers, particularly among the males.

"Intensive therapy for small-cell lung cancer using carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mid-cycle vincristine, and radiotherapy.
 Forty patients with small-cell lung cancer (31 patients with limited-stage [LS] disease, and nine patients with extensive-stage [ES] disease but of good performance status) have been treated with an intensive therapy composed of carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide with vincristine on day 14 of each carboplatin cycle.
 A maximum of six cycles were administered at 3 weekly intervals after the cisplatin combination and 4 weekly after the carboplatin combination.
 Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given with the first cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation with the third cycle.
 The median nadir for neutrophils was 0.47 x 10(9)/L and for platelets, 40 x 10(9)/L.
 Chemotherapy dosages were not reduced in response to myelosuppression, but treatment was delayed to allow blood count recovery.
 Sixty-eight percent of patients received all six cycles of chemotherapy, and there were four deaths associated with treatment-related neutropenia.
 Twenty-eight patients (70%) achieved a complete response (CR) when assessed 1 month after the end of treatment, and a further five patients (12.5%) had a partial response (PR).
 Median duration of CR was 16 months and of PR, 8 months.
 Cerebral metastases occurred in 20% of all patients and was the apparent sole site of relapse in 11% of the CR patients.
 The median survival of the total group was 14 months with an actual 2-year survival of 30% and a minimum follow-up of 28 months.

"Recurrent laryngeal nerve section for spastic dysphonia: 5- to 14-year preliminary results in the first 300 patients.
 This presentation compares the preoperative voice recordings and the latest follow-up voice recordings, made 5 to 14 years postoperatively, of the first 300 patients with various degrees of spastic dysphonia whom we treated with recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) sections from 1975 to 1982.
 Voice therapy was usually given afterward and in some patients, when necessary, ""fine tuning"" surgery was performed later.
 The 243 patients who could be located were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding their voice production and communication abilities, and to make a voice recording.
 The preoperative and long-term postoperative voice recordings were analyzed by means of perceptual voice evaluation and acoustic analysis of the voice spectra.
 Fifteen percent developed recurrence of mild to moderate spasticity 6 to 24 months after the RLN section.
 This was curable with laser vocal cord thinning via direct laryngoscopy.
 Eighty-two percent of patients had little or no voice spasticity 5 to 14 years after their RLN section.

"Comparison of thermodilution and transthoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiac outputs.
 Current methods of measuring cardiac output require the invasive insertion of a thermodilution catheter with its concomitant risks and complications.
 We examined the noninvasive method of transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) in comparison with thermodilution cardiac outputs in a sample of 44 critically ill patients with poor left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%) and with either ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
 Dyspnea, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and difference between real and ideal weight had the most marked effects on the correlation between the two methods, with lesser influence by left ventricular ejection fraction, height, weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and aortic regurgitation.
 TEB and thermodilution cardiac outputs were correlated, at r = 0.51 (p less than 0.00009), but the low reliability and low percentage of TEB readings within 0.5 L/min of thermodilution cardiac outputs (31%) renders TEB inadequate for clinical measurement of cardiac outputs in this patient population.

"Necrotizing tracheobronchitis: complication of mechanical ventilation in an adult.
 A 51-year-old woman had localized interstitial pneumonia that rapidly progressed to involve all lung fields.
 After 9 days of conventional mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax developed in the presence of an obstruction of the right main bronchus.
 Bronchoscopy and endobronchial biopsies revealed NTB involving the tracheobronchial tree distal to the tip of the endotracheal tube, with complete obstruction of the right main bronchus by hard, eschar-like material.
 Tracheal mucosa proximal to the tip of the endotracheal tube was normal.
 Subsequent bronchoscopy, 20 days later, showed marked resolution of NTB.
 Though a frequent complication of mechanical ventilation in the neonate, NTB as a complication of conventional mechanical ventilation has not previously been recognized in an adult.

 Twenty-three patients with marginally resectable and unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (stages IIIA and IIIB) were treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
 All patients received three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with two alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide 2.5 g/m2 intravenously (i.v.) and ifosfamide 3.5 g/m2 i.v., mesna 12 g/m2 was given additionally to prevent drug hematuria.
 Six of 23 patients (26%) had partial response.
 Of the seven patients who underwent thoracotomy, two were completely resected, but with macroscopic residual disease.
 Mean time to progression for the whole group was 7 months.
 Fifteen patients had progression of disease, with local metastases only in six, and distant metastases in eight.
 After administering 52 chemotherapy cycles, cyclophosphamide-ifosfamide doses were cut down, as eight of 16 patients required hospitalization for fever during neutropenia nadirs.
 This two-alkylating (non-cisplatin) regimen, unlike cisplatin-based regimens, was ineffective, and further trials are not recommended.

"Morphology of the airway wall in asthma and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are complex conditions with imprecise definitions, which make definitive morphologic comparisons difficult.
 Broadly, the airways in asthma are occluded by tenacious plugs of exudate and mucus, and there is fragility of airway surface epithelium, thickening of the reticular layer beneath the epithelial basal lamina, and bronchial vessel congestion and edema.
 There is increased inflammatory infiltrate comprising ""activated"" lymphocytes and eosinophils with release of granular content in the latter, and there is enlargement of bronchial smooth muscle, particularly in medium-sized bronchi.
 Three conditions contribute to COPD.
 In chronic bronchitis there is mucous hypersecretion with enlargement of tracheobronchial submucosal glands and a disproportionate increase of mucous acini.
 In small or peripheral airways disease, there is inflammation of bronchioli and mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia, with increased intraluminal mucus, increased wall muscle, fibrosis, and airway stenoses.
 Respiratory bronchiolitis is a critically important early lesion that may predispose to the development of centrilobular emphysema.
 The severity of emphysema, rather than type, appears to be the most important determinant of chronic deterioration of airflow, and in this there may be significant loss of elastic recoil prior to the observed morphologic destruction of the acinus.

"Ultrastructural localization of proteinase 3, the target antigen of anti-cytoplasmic antibodies circulating in Wegener's granulomatosis.
 To investigate the distribution of proteinase 3, the target antigen of anti-cytoplasmic antibodies (ACPA or C-ANCA), within the organelles of resting normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes, the authors used immunocytochemical techniques on thin frozen sections.
 To obtain valuable tools for immunolabeling, two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the ACPA antigen were produced.
 In neutrophils, the authors observed immunogold label for the ACPA antigen, predominantly in myeloperoxidase-positive azurophil granules, and in smaller amounts on the plasma membrane.
 In monocytes, the ACPA antigen could be detected in small granules, which occasionally also contained myeloperoxidase, and rare labeling was found on the monocyte membrane.
 The finding that the ACPA antigen is expressed on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and monocytes, thereby becoming accessible to circulating autoantibodies, supports the supposition that ACPA are not only markers of disease activity, but also are involved in the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis.

"Lower respiratory tract iron burden is increased in association with cigarette smoking.
 Iron, by catalyzing the generation of the hydroxyl radical via the Haber-Weiss reaction, may participate in oxidant tissue injury.
 To determine whether iron might contribute to cigarette smoke-induced lung injury, we estimated the iron content of the lower respiratory tract by measuring intracellular iron content of pulmonary macrophages and extracellular iron content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from cigarette smokers and nonsmokers.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed by using methods that allow for recovery of samples enriched for bronchial and alveolar contents.
 The intracellular iron content of the alveolar macrophages was determined by staining cytocentrifuged, air-dried pulmonary macrophages with a modified Prussian blue stain and assigning a score of 0 to 3 (0 = no stain, 3 = dense staining throughout the cytoplasm) to 100 macrophages.
 The extracellular iron level of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by using modifications of the Ferrozine method of Carter.
 Macrophage intracellular iron content was measured in a group of cigarette smokers with chronic bronchitis (n = 17), in smokers without chronic bronchitis (n = 15), and in normal volunteers (n = 15).
 Extracellular iron concentration was determined in a subset of the subjects with chronic bronchitis (n = 12) and in a separate group of normal volunteers (n = 5).
 The intracellular iron score was elevated in the bronchial sample lavage fluid in both the smokers with chronic bronchitis (45.3 +/- 13.9) and the asymptomatic smokers (26.6 +/- 8.0) compared with the normal individuals (8.1 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.03, both comparisons), but did not differ between the two groups of cigarette-smoking subjects (p = 0.68).

 Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is a marker of T lymphocyte activation.
 We measured the amount of serum sIL-2R in 35 patients with active tuberculosis before the initiation of antituberculous treatment.
 Twenty had pulmonary parenchymal lesion, 8 had tuberculous pleural effusion, and 7 had tuberculous lymphadenitis.
 The serum sIL-2R values were markedly elevated in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (parenchymal lesion and pleural effusion) compared with patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis (2,612 +/- 536 versus 538 +/- 121 U/ml, p = 0.023), old, inactive tuberculosis (335 +/- 23 U/ml, p = 0.001), and normal control subjects (376 +/- 38 U/ml, p = 0.001).
 No significant difference was found between patients with parenchymal lesion and those with tuberculous pleural effusion.
 There was a positive correlation between serum sIL-2R values and the extent of disease on chest radiograph (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001).
 We conclude that the amount of sIL-2R may be a useful marker of disease activity and extent of involvement in patients with active tuberculous lesions.

"Phrenic nerve injury. A prospective study.
 In cardiac surgery, topical iced saline solution slush has become an important adjunct in maintaining myocardial hypothermia during cardioplegic arrest.
 One complication of this technique is phrenic nerve injury (PNI).
 In an attempt to reduce the incidence of PNI, a prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of phrenic nerve insulation on PNI during cardiac surgery.
 Seventy-six consecutive patients who underwent coronary revascularization constituted the control group (CG) and were compared with 76 patients who underwent a similar procedure with the addition of phrenic nerve insulation.
 In the intervention group (IG), a foam insulation pad was placed between the heart and the pericardium in an effort to reduce exposure of the phrenic nerve to iced saline solution slush.
 There was no difference in major demographic descriptors or operative variables between the CG and the IG, except that the internal mammary artery was used more frequently in the IG (64 percent vs 36 percent, p = 0.0006).
 The in-hospital mortality was similar between the groups (CG, 0.0 percent; IG, 1.3 percent; p = 1.0); however, the incidence of roentgenographically diagnosed PNI was much greater in the CG (14/76 patients [18 percent] vs 0/76 patients [0 percent]; p = 0.0006).
 Patients with and without PNI were similar with regard to age, gender, aortic cross clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and number of grafts (p greater than 0.05).
 All unilateral PNI occurred on the left.
 Three patients with bilateral PNI required tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
 In-hospital mortality was similar for patients with and without PNI (0 percent vs 0.7 percent), but mean postoperative hospital stay for patients with clinically diagnosed PNI was longer than for those without PNI (32 vs 11 days, p = 0.04).
 This prospective study demonstrates that the incidence of PNI can be significantly reduced by the routine use of phrenic nerve insulation.

 Fifteen patients were females and 24 males.
 The tumors were located at the parotid gland (n = 30), the submaxillary gland (n = 1), the soft palate (n = 5) and the oral mucosa NOS (n = 3).
 At presentation 4 tumors were intraglandular and 35 extraglandular; three patients had lymph node metastases and one patient lung metastases.

"Surfactant replacement therapy with a single postventilatory dose of a reconstituted bovine surfactant in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome: final analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial and comparison with similar trials. The Surfactant-TA Study Group.
 The effects of a single dose of surfactant TA were assessed in premature neonates (birth weight 750 to 1749 g) with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.
 Only neonates with surfactant deficiency and without ultrasonographic evidence of intracranial hemorrhage greater than or equal to grade II were enrolled.
 Fifty-four patients received surfactant (100 mg of phospholipid per kilogram of body weight) and 46 patients received an air placebo within 8 hours of life.
 Treatment with this surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of RDS with a concomitant increase in the proportion of neonates with mild disease.
 The frequency of pulmonary interstitial emphysema and of pneumothorax was significantly lower in treated neonates compared with control neonates (2% vs 26%, P = .0008, and 7% vs 39%, P = .0004, respectively).
 The frequency of intracranial hemorrhage was significantly lower in the surfactant group compared with the control group (20% vs 54%, P = .0008) and was also reduced for the smallest neonates in the surfactant group (13% vs 73%, P = .00008).
 When categorized according to severity of intracranial hemorrhage and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the surfactant group was at a significant advantage (adjusted Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel X2 = 10.72, P less than .001 and X2 = 4.43, P = .036, respectively).
 The proportion of neonates surviving without intracranial hemorrhage and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia was 63% in the surfactant group vs 26% in the control group (P = .0004); as for the smallest neonates, it was 58% in the surfactant group vs 4% in the control group (P = .0002).
 There were no differences between the groups with respect to the frequency of patent ductus arteriosus (46% vs 37%), pulmonary hemorrhage (6% vs 7%), necrotizing enterocolitis (0% vs 2%), sepsis (4% vs 2%), retinopathy of prematurity (13% vs 22%), or death (15% vs 22%).
 It is concluded that treatment with the single-dose surfactant regimen used in this study reduces the severity of respiratory distress during the 48 hours after treatment and decreases the major pulmonary morbidity and intracranial hemorrhage in premature neonates with RDS.
 Further studies are needed to determine whether (1) treatment at birth or as soon as after RDS is diagnosed and (2) the use of multiple dose of this surfactant would result in any additional benefits.

"The prognostic value of endotracheal tube-air leak following tracheal surgery in children.
 In an effort to determine if the endotracheal tube-leak pressure has prognostic value in relation to a successful outcome after one-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction or cricoid split surgery, a retrospective analysis was performed on 17 children who had undergone such surgery.
 The daily leak pressures, length of intubation, and ultimate outcome of attempts at extubation were noted.
 One hundred percent of patients with a leak pressure of less than 20 cm H2O on the day before extubation were successfully extubated.
 In contrast, the failure rate was 100% in children extubated with a leak of greater than 30 mm H2O.
 The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (chi 2, 13.03).
 Sixty percent of patients with leak pressures in the range of 21 to 30 cm H2O were successfully extubated.
 The endotracheal tube-leak pressure is a parameter that has prognostic value, and should be considered in determining when to extubate children who have undergone tracheal reconstructive surgery.

 The inability to increase alveolar ventilation can lead to CO2 retention and acute respiratory acidosis in patients with ventilatory limitation.
 In this case, a young woman receiving maximum ventilatory support was unable to excrete excess CO2, associated with increasing dianeal concentrations of peritoneal dialysis.
 Since the patient's lung disease had necessitated a large amount of ventilatory support, the patient was unable to increase VE appropriately to handle excess CO2.
 Peritoneal dialysate was an additional source of carbohydrates.
 Peritoneal dialysate is an additional carbohydrate source that may result in hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis in patients with respiratory compromise.
 To our knowledge, this is the first case report in an adult which demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis with high glucose loads produced an acute respiratory acidosis that was reversed by decreasing the glucose concentrations in the dialysate.
 Excess CO2 production should be considered with respiratory disorders associated with dialysis.

"Immune reactivity in bronchogenic carcinoma and its relation to 5-year survival rate.
 We performed a prospective study on the correlation of various parameters of the immune response with the 5-year survival rate in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.
 Parameters were initially examined before starting treatment.
 Delayed hypersensitivity skin tests, lymphoblastogenesis, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production were employed to assess immune competence.
 Each reaction was classified into four or five grades in accordance with intensity; the 5-year survival rate of the patients showing each grade of the immune response was calculated.
 A correlation between response before treatment and the survival rate was most clearly noted for lymphoblastogenesis.
 The skin tests and the NK cell activity showed poorer correlations, and no exact correlation was noted between the IL-2 production and the immune response.

"CT of the paranasal sinuses and functional endoscopic surgery: a critical analysis of 100 symptomatic patients.
 CT scans of 100 patients from the Rhinology Clinic at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital were reviewed in order to test the precepts forming the basis of functional endoscopic sinus surgery, especially as they relate to the radiological investigation.
 These were: (a) the site of origin of sinus infection, (b) The relevance of certain anatomical variants in the middle meatus to sinus infection and (c) The use of CT as the radiological method of diagnosis in all cases.
 Obstruction in the middle meatus and ostiomeatal complex was associated with an increased incidence of opacity in the sinuses but the primary site of disease was not established: the concept that sinus disease takes origin in the middle meatus was not proven.
 Anatomical variants in the middle meatus were not associated with an increase in sinus opacity and there was no evidence that these anomalies have any effect on sinus disease by causing middle meatal stenosis.
 The radiological assessment of patients with inflammatory naso-sinus disease should start with plain X-ray.
 CT is unnecessary as a routine examination.
 It should be reserved for the pre-operative assessment of patients for endoscopic surgery, its main function being to show important anatomical landmarks.

"Nasal reconstruction with articulated irradiated rib cartilage.
 Nasal structural reconstruction is a formidable task in cases where there is loss of support to both the nasal dorsum and tip.
 A multitude of surgical approaches and materials have been used for the correction of the saddle-nose deformity with varying degrees of success.
 Articulated irradiated rib cartilage inserted through an external rhinoplasty approach was used to reconstruct nasal deformities in 18 patients over a 6-year period.
 Simultaneous use of a midline forehead flap to reconstruct the overlying soft tissue was required in four cases.
 Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 2.8 years).
 Results were rewarding in most cases with marked improvement in nasal support and airway.
 Revision and/or replacement secondary to trauma or warping of the graft was required in four cases.
 None of the patients exhibited infection, extrusion, or noticeable resorption.
 A description of the surgical technique, review of all the cases, and recommendation for continued use of this graft material are discussed.

"Nutritional effects on response of children in developing countries to respiratory tract pathogens: implications for vaccine development.
 Malnutrition and respiratory disease commonly occur together, and the immunologic defects caused by malnutrition may affect clinical responses and the impact of vaccines.
 These defects include impaired maturation and function of T lymphocytes, diminished secretory immune responses, poor humoral antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens, deficient complement activity (especially the alternative pathway), and impaired antimicrobial mechanisms by phagocytic cells.
 In addition, protein-energy malnutrition often leads to very high serum levels of IgE as a result of altered T cell regulation of IgE production and may contribute to IgE-mediated pathologic responses to respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus infection.
 Correction of these deficits may improve host response to infection and enhance vaccine-related protection.
 Both vitamin A and iron deficiency states have been epidemiologically associated with increased morbidity due to respiratory infection.
 The impact of preventive therapy with either vitamin A or iron is still uncertain, but such therapy has the potential for diminishing the incidence of respiratory infections and their consequences.

"Localization and visualization of pulmonary emboli with radiolabeled fibrin-specific monoclonal antibody.
 Indium-111-labeled monoclonal antibody 64C5 specific for the beta-chain of fibrin monomer was used to image canine (n = 6) experimental pulmonary emboli (at least one barium-thrombin and one copper-coil induced clot per dog).
 Uptake of 111In-64C5 and 125I-control-DIG26-11 were compared in 10 clots (7 barium-thrombin and 3 copper-coil) identified in the lungs.
 There was no difference in the blood clearance of 111In-64C5 and 125I-DIG26-11.
 Uptake of 111In-64C5 (0.183 +/- 0.105, mean %ID/g) was greater than 125I-DIG26-11 (0.024 +/- 0.025) in pulmonary clots (p less than 0.001).
 Mean thrombus to blood ratios at 24 hr were 6.78:1 for 64C5 and 0.57:1 for DIG26-11.
 The clots visualized in vivo were larger (0.315 +/- 0.381 g) than clots not visualized (0.089 +/- 0.098).
 Negative images were recorded in three dogs with pulmonary emboli, injected with 111In-labeled control monoclonal antibody 3H3.
 These data suggest that 111In-labeled antifibrin can detect large pulmonary emboli in vivo.

"Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis.
 Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC).
 We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC.
 One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta.
 Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death.
 Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung.
 Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate.
 Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population.
 Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications.

"Transforming growth factor beta 1 is present at sites of extracellular matrix gene expression in human pulmonary fibrosis.
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an inexorably fatal disorder characterized by connective tissue deposition within the terminal air spaces resulting in loss of lung function and eventual respiratory failure.
 Previously, we demonstrated that foci of activated fibroblasts expressing high levels of fibronectin, procollagen, and smooth muscle actin and thus resembling those found in healing wounds are responsible for the connective tissue deposition and scarring in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
 Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we now demonstrate the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent profibrotic cytokine, in the foci containing these activated fibroblasts.
 These results suggest that matrix-associated TGF-beta 1 may serve as a stimulus for the persistent expression of connective tissue genes.
 One potential source of the TGF-beta 1 is the alveolar macrophage, and we demonstrate the expression of abundant TGF-beta 1 mRNA in alveolar macrophages in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

"Peak inspiratory pressure requirements in infants born weighing less than 750 g.
 The possibility that peak inspiratory pressure requirements or the arterial:alveolar oxygen ratio can predict the clinical outcome in infants weighing less than 750 g at birth was explored in a consecutive series.
 Nine of 10 infants (90%) with a peak inspiratory pressure requirement of more than 18 cm H2O at 48 hours or more than 16 cm H2O at 72 hours from age subsequently died later of respiratory causes (defined as death after 72 hours of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or cor pulmonale).
 Twenty of 21 remaining infants (95%) survived until discharge.
 Using these data a 95th centile for peak inspiratory pressure requirement during the first 72 hours of life was constructed.
 The potential value of this centile in predicting later death of respiratory causes was examined in a separate series.
 Twelve of 15 infants (80%) whose peak inspiratory pressure requirements remained below the 95th centile, or were not ventilated (n = 6), survived.
 In contrast, 11 of 12 (92%) infants whose requirements crossed the 95th centile died later of respiratory causes.
 The infants who died had more radiological changes and higher mean arterial carbon dioxide pressure than survivors suggesting that the severity of the initial lung disease rather than the way that ventilation was managed determined prognosis.
 Peak inspiratory pressure requirement was more useful than arterial:alveolar oxygen ratio in clearly distinguishing between survivors and infants who died later of respiratory causes.

"Effect of positive airway pressure on capillary transit time in rabbit lung.
 We used fluorescence videomicroscopy to measure the passage of fluorescent dye through the subpleural microcirculation of the lung.
 With the rabbit in the left lateral decubitus position, the subpleural microcirculation was viewed either through a transparent parietal pleural window located in the superior part of the chest or directly with the chest open.
 There was no physical contact with the chest or lung.
 The rabbit was anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with 100% O2.
 The dye was injected into the right ventricle during a 2-min apneic period to eliminate lung movement due to ventilation.
 The video signal of the passage of the dye was analyzed frame by frame by use of digital image processing to compensate for cardiogenic oscillations of the lung surface.
 Gray scale levels of an arteriole and adjacent venule were measured every 1/30 s.
 Capillary transit time was determined from the difference between the concentration-weighted mean time values of the arteriolar and venular dye dilution curves.
 We studied the effect of airway pressure (0-20 cmH2O) on transit time.
 Cardiac output was measured at different airway pressures by the thermal dilution technique.
 Capillary transit time averaged 0.60 s at functional residual capacity.
 Right ventricular-to-arteriolar transit time was four times as large as the capillary transit time.
 An increase in airway pressure from 0-5 to 20 cmH2O resulted in a fourfold increase in both capillary and arterial transit times and a threefold decrease in cardiac output.

"Factor analysis in difficult tracheal intubation: laryngoscopy-induced airway obstruction.
 We have studied eight patients with a history of difficult tracheal intubation, using x-ray laryngoscopy and local anaesthesia, a curved Macintosh blade and a standard intubating position.
 The view obtained was better than recorded previously during general anaesthesia in two patients, and in a third the x-ray showed that positioning the blade tip beneath the epiglottis would have improved vision, suggesting that reproducibility of the assessment may not be consistent.
 The ""ease of intubation"" and ""complementary"" angles may be helpful in the assessment of such patients.
 A ""peardrop"" effect is described whereby during laryngoscopy, the epiglottis became pressed against the posterior pharyngeal wall as a result of tongue compression.
 In the absence of muscle paralysis, removal of the blade caused immediate correction.
 However, during anaesthesia with neuromuscular block it is suggested that this not only occurs more readily but, may not correct when the blade is removed.
 Iatrogenic airway obstruction during moderately difficult tracheal intubation may be common and should be anticipated.

"Data compression: effect on diagnostic accuracy in digital chest radiography.
 High-resolution digital images make up very large data sets that are relatively slow to transmit and expensive to store.
 Data compression techniques are being developed to address this problem, but significant image deterioration can occur at high compression ratios.
 In this study, the authors evaluated a form of adaptive block cosine transform coding, a new compression technique that allows considerable compression of digital radiographs with minimal degradation of image quality.
 To determine the effect of data compression on diagnostic accuracy, observer tests were performed with 60 digitized chest radiographs (2,048 x 2,048 matrix, 1,024 shades of gray) containing subtle examples of pneumothorax, interstitial infiltrate, nodules, and bone lesions.
 Radiographs with no compression, with 25:1 compression, and with 50:1 compression ratios were presented in randomized order to 12 radiologists.
 The results suggest that, with this compression scheme, compression ratios as high as 25:1 may be acceptable for primary diagnosis in chest radiology.

"Predicting risk of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.
 Effective prophylaxis exists against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, a major cause of illness and death among human immunodeficiency virus-infected children and adults.
 While adults with CD4 counts less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L are at highest risk for Pneumocystis carinii, clinical or laboratory markers of high risk in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus have not yet been established.
 A chart review of 13 infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection and children with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia revealed that infants younger than 12 months developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia despite CD4 counts that were normal by adult standards.
 In contrast to the markedly increased serum IgG levels seen in most children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, five children with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had IgG levels less than 3.0 g/L.
 Twelve patients had pre-existing symptoms consistent with human immunodeficiency virus infection before the episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 In addition to clinical symptoms, low IgG levels and CD4 counts adjusted for age may serve to identify those children who are most at risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and therefore candidates for prophylaxis.
 Prophylaxis should be offered to all infants under age 12 months with proven, or clinical symptoms compatible with, human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 For children older than 12 months, CD4 counts less than 0.3 x 10(9)/L appear to be predictive of risk for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and these children should also receive prophylaxis.

"Acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in children associated with afternoon weather changes.
 We studied the effect of the weather on acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma in children by comparing records of 8,657 admissions for five acute respiratory diseases (3,064 for asthma) with concurrent meteorologic data.
 These diseases were classified according to their interrelations and distinct meteorologic patterns into two groups: (1) acute asthma and acute laryngitis, which are correlated with the afternoon gradients of air temperature, heat content (the thermal energy of the ambient air), and modified heat content factor (the energy required to heat the air water vapor to the ambient temperature), but not correlated with the absolute values of air temperature and water content: and (2), bronchopneumonia/pneumonia and upper respiratory infections, which are correlated only with the absolute values of the meteorologic parameters (air temperature, water content, heat content, and modified heat content factor), but not with their afternoon gradients.
 Admissions for bronchiolitis revealed an age-related pattern: up to 1 yr they resembled Group 2 and from 1 to 2 yr, Group 1.
 It follows that the admission rates of acute exacerbation of bronchial asthma in childhood are linked both to the afternoon weather gradients and to some of the acute respiratory infections.

"Failure of therapy with 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid to modify the course of sepsis-induced lung injury.
 Oxidant-induced injury of the pulmonary microvasculature reportedly contributes to an increase in microvascular permeability and pulmonary hypertension, both of which are principal features of acute lung injury (ALI).
 We tested the hypothesis that antioxidant therapy with 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), initiated in awake sheep after the development of sepsis-induced ALI, would ameliorate the progression of these lesions.
 DHB has many actions that suggested to us the potential for demonstrating benefit in ALI complicating sepsis; it is a nontoxic hydroxyl-radical scavenger that also inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway and acts as a weak iron chelator.
 In preliminary experiments, we demonstrated that pretreatment with DHB prevented an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure, plasma thromboxane A2, measured as its metabolite thromboxane B2, and lymph total protein clearance that otherwise followed an infusion of zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) in sheep.
 In subsequent experiments, 12 additional sheep were rendered septic by cecal ligation and perforation.
 Twenty-four to 36 h after cecal ligation and perforation, an increase in lung microvascular permeability was confirmed, because pulmonary lymph flow had increased by 82% while the mean lymph-to-plasma total protein ratio was unchanged from baseline.
 At this point, six sheep were then treated with parenteral DHB and six with DHB vehicle for the subsequent 24 h.
 In contrast to the demonstrated benefit of DHB pretreatment in preventing ALI secondary to an infusion of ZAP, the progressive increase in lymph total protein clearance that complicated septic lung injury in the DHB vehicle group throughout this 24-h study period was not ameliorated in the DHB treatment group.
 However, DHB did prevent a modest increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressures that was demonstrated in the DHB vehicle group throughout this 24-h treatment period.
 Although pretreatment prevented ALI after a ZAP infusion, we conclude that DHB only incompletely modified disease progression when administered after the onset of sepsis-induced ALI because it ameliorated the pulmonary hypertensive response without concurrently modifying an increase in lung microvascular fluid flux.

"Treatment of decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department--correlation between clinical features and prognosis.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: Patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at high risk of relapse after treatment in an emergency department.
 The purpose of this study was to determine if the risk of relapse correlates with the clinical features of the disease.
 PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-two patients with documented COPD who were treated for dyspnea in the ED of the Albuquerque Veterans Administration Medical Center over a three-year period.
 METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features and pulmonary function tests of the patients, who were considered to have COPD if the baseline prebronchodilator one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was less than 80% predicted, and less than 80% of the forced vital capacity and inhaled bronchodilators failed to increase the FEV1 to levels of more than 80% predicted.
 Visits for pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary emboli were excluded.
 A relapse was defined as an unscheduled revisit to the ED within 14 days of initial treatment.
 Data were entered into a microcomputer data base and analyzed by a commercial statistical package.
 RESULTS: Of 877 visits in which the patient was treated and released from the ED, 281 (32.0%) resulted in relapse and were considered unsuccessful Compared with successful visits, unsuccessful visits were characterized by a shorter duration of dyspnea (P = .002), a lower entry FEV1 (P = .027), a lower discharge FEV1 (P = .040), a greater number of treatments with nebulized bronchodilators (P = .009), more frequent use of parenteral adrenergic drugs (P = .006), and less frequent use of oral prednisone on discharge (P = .016).
 Patients with one or more relapse visits during the study period (relapsers) differed from nonrelapsers in several respects.
 Relapsers had a greater bronchodilator response on baseline FEV1 than nonrelapsers (P = .047).
 Nevertheless, relapsers required more bronchodilator treatments in the ED (P less than .001); were treated more frequently with parenteral adrenergic drugs (P less than .001), IV glucocorticoids (P less than .001), and oral prednisone (P less than .001); and recovered less of their baseline FEV1 (P less than .014).
 CONCLUSION: Bronchodilator response on baseline pulmonary function testing appears to identify patients with COPD who have a poor prognosis after emergency treatment.
 Their poor response to intensive bronchodilator treatment suggests that loss of bronchodilator response may be involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory decompensation.

"Respiratory failure and unilateral caudal brainstem infarction.
 We report clinicotopographic correlations in 2 patients with central hypoventilation and unilateral infarct in the caudal brainstem.
 One patient had nearly complete loss of ventilation involving both automatic and voluntary components.
 He showed no ventilator response during a CO2 retention test (PaCO2 62 mm Hg, PaO2 82 mm Hg), while consciousness was preserved until death.
 The infarct involved the reticular formation, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus retroambiguus on the right but spared the dorsal motor nucleus of the tenth cranial nerve, and sensory and corticospinal tracts.
 The second patient showed hypoventilation more selectively involving automatic responses (Ondine's curse).
 The infarct involved the medullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus but spared the nucleus tractus solitarius.
 We suggest that unilateral involvement of pontomedullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus is sufficient for generating loss of automatic respiration, while associated lesion of the nucleus tractus solitarius may lead to more severe respiratory failure involving both automatic and voluntary responses.

"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Abnormalities in the bronchoalveolar lavage content of surfactant protein A.
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease of the lung characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate, alveolar type II cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and ultimate parenchymal scarring.
 The phospholipid composition of the surface-active material recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is abnormal in this disease.
 In the present study we have extended the analysis of surfactant components in IPF to include the major surfactant-associated protein, surfactant protein A (SP-A).
 SP-A has been reported to be essential for the formation of tubular myelin, to facilitate the adsorption of phospholipid to the air/liquid interface, and to stimulate uptake and inhibit secretion of surfactant in vitro.
 The BAL of 25 normal volunteers and 42 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) was analyzed for surfactant protein A content by ELISA and for phospholipids.
 The changes in BAL components were correlated to histopathologic markers at open-lung biopsy, clinical status, and survival.
 The total phospholipid (PL) recovered at lavage was reduced in patients with IPF relative to normal volunteers (p less than 0.0005).
 In addition, the percentage of phosphatidyl-glycerol (% PG) was decreased in patients with IPF (p less than 0.0001), whereas the percentage of phosphatidylcholine that was saturated was not altered.
 The content of surfactant protein A in lavage was reduced, even when normalized for the total amount of surface-active material recovered (SP-A/PL) (p less than 0.007).
 The reduction in SP-A was not specific to IPF but also occurred in other interstitial lung diseases.
